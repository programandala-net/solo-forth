= Solo Forth Aknowledgments

Solo Forth started with the code of Abersoft Forth, that was
first studied and much improved
(http://programandala.net/en.program.afera.html) and finally
fully disassembled
(http://programandala.net/en.program.abersoft_forth.html).

Solo Forth was made possible thanks to code, documentation,
ideas and inspiration from the following Forth systems
(acknowledgment notes are included in the source, at the
correspondent places):

  al., 1980-1984.
- DZX-Forth (for ZX Spectrum +3e), by Marcos Cruz, 2014 (under
  development).
- eForth (for MS-DOS), by Bill Muench, 1989-1997.
