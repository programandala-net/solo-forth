= Solo Forth Acknowledgments

Solo Forth started with the code of Abersoft Forth, that was
first studied and much improved
(http://programandala.net/en.program.afera.html) and finally
fully disassembled
(http://programandala.net/en.program.abersoft_forth.html).

Solo Forth was made possible thanks to code, documentation,
ideas and inspiration from the following Forth systems,
listed in alphabetical order:
