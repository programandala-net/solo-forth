// This file is part of Solo Forth
// http://programandala.net/en.program.solo_forth.html

Solo Forth started from the code of Abersoft Forth (a tape-based
fig-Forth 1.1 for ZX Spectrum 48K), which was first studied and much
improved (http://programandala.net/en.program.afera.html) and finally
fully disassembled
(http://programandala.net/en.program.abersoft_forth.html).

Solo Forth is being possible thanks to code, documentation, ideas and
inspiration from the following Forth systems and libraries, listed in
alphabetical order:
