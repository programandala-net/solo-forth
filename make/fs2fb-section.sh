# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Description

# This program converts a Forth source file from text to blocks,
# compacting it by removing empty lines and FSB metacomments.  This
# makes it possible to write a Forth program in ordinary text format,
# without the constraints imposed by the intermediate format FSB, and
# then integrate it into the Solo Forth library disk, in order to load
# it as a whole with `load-section name`.
#
# The only requisite of the source is that its first actual line of
# code (the first line that is not empty or an FSB metacomment) must
# be a block header, with a name as identifier (a word surrounded by
# spaces), which will be used with `load-section`.
