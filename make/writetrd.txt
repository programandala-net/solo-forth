
				WRITETRD  v1.0
				==============

		MS-DOS or .TAP file to Betadisk image writer.
				(public domain)
 Syntax: WRITETRD image_file file
 	 where image_file is a raw dump of Betadisk (TR-DOS) formatted
	 diskette (without sector IDs)
	 and file is the name of converted file.

 Function: This program writes a specified file to a Betadisk diskette
	   image file for futher use in some TR-DOS Spectrum emulator
	   under MS-DOS or writing back to a TR-DOS diskette.

	Normal MS-DOS file writes it as CODE file, the blocks of .TAP
	file as BASIC, CODE or DATA file. Special case is a headerless
	file. Headerless file is written using the standard invented by
	the author: filename is "NoHeader", type "CODE", in start field
	is stored the flagbyte and in length field the filelength.

 Error messages: A error message is given when image_file or file doesn't
		 exist, or specified image_file isn't a valid image file.
		 For writing files there are these limitations:
		 1) The written file may not be longer than 0xff00 bytes
		 2) In the dump directory can't be more than 128 files
		 3) On the disk image must be enough free space for a file.
		 If any of these conditions fails, a error message appears
		 and the writing process terminates. The conditions are
		 tested before processing each block of .TAP file.

 Note: The program doesn't handle snapshot file formats .SNA, .Z80, .SP etc.
