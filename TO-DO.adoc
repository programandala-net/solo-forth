.2015-11-12:

`+bal`, `-bal` or similar, to change `csp`:

----
: [+csp]  ( -- )  [ cell negate ] literal csp +!  ; immediate compile-only
: [-csp]  ( -- )  cell csp +!  ; immediate compile-only
----

But for compiling an external number inside a definition,
a trick is `[ dup ] literal` and a `drop` after `;`.


.2015-11-10:

On +3DOS, reserve one memory bank for the name fields.

Move the circular string buffer to the top of memory.  Use `high` or
similar, like fig-Forth, to protect the string buffer and the heap. In
fact, the string buffer should be defined in the heap, but a small
implementation of the heap is needed.

.2015-11-04:

`cold` must do `mode32`!

.2015-06-09:

In order to save compilation time, move inner words to the bottom of
the dictionary. Example: `(loop)`, `clit`, `back`, `digit`...

.2015-06-30:

New: command history, stored in the names bank.

Change: remove double `;s` from the colon words in the kernel. Use
`exit` instead, else the word can not be decoded. [2015-08-12: Two
cases found and marked.]

Change: compare the user variables with those of Spectrum Forth-83.

.2015-08-12:

Change: make the vocabulary links point to the pfa of the
vocabularies? `vocabulary` should be adapted too. The advantage is the
pfa is also the id used in search order and returned by `wordlist`.
A word `pfa>vlfa` would be helpful.

Ideas from cmForth:

____

LOOP         Test the top item on the return stack.  If it is zero,
pop it off the return stack and continue executing the next
instruction. ÃŠIf it is not zero, decrement it and jump to the address
specified in this instruction.  Address specifier is the same as in
BRANCH.  LOOP is compiled by NEXT.

REPEATS      Repeat the next instruction if the count on top of the
return stack is not zero.  The count is also decremented.  If count is
zero, pop the return stack and continue executing the following
instruction.  REPEATS is  compiled by        TIMES or OF(.

The REPEATS instruction is used frequently to implement complicated
math operations, like shifts, multiply, divide and square root, from
appropriate math step instructions.  It is also useful in repeating
auto-indexing memory instructions.

== Turnkey ==
// {{{

.2015-07-23:

Study how to save and load the main code and the name bank apart, in
two files. This way `turnkey` could be used also to save a modified
copy of the system, not just Forth programs. Simpler solution: use the
snapshop option of the +D.

.2015-08-31:

Problem: a szx snapshot does not preserve the mounted disks, and even
worse, it does not preserve G+DOS!

Of course the +D own snapshots can be used to save the status of a
game, but this means programs have to be started manually, typing
`run` in BASIC to load G+DOS, and then loading the snapshot file.

== Disk blocks ==

.2015-08-15:

Idea: maybe 0 could be used instead of 0x7fff to init the block number of a buffer.

Idea: instead of update bit, `negate` the number. Then `abs` can be used.

.2015-08-31:

Fix: `transfer-block` changes the current drive to 2!

.2015-06-10:

New: A printing routine instead the ROM routines, with two fonts: for
chars 0..127 and for chars 128..255.

.2015-09-05:

There's an example how to change and restore a channel in print-42, by
Ricardo Serral Wigge. Beside, it supports many (all?) control
characters, unlike the implementation by Andy Jenkinson.

.2015-09-08:

Fix: `bye` resets the system when `mode42` is on. Move `mode32` to the
kernel and set it before going back to BASIC. Restore the previous
mode after a warm entry.

.2015-09-11:

Idea: screen modes table?

- 0: 32 cpl original (ROM routines)
- 1: 32 cpl improved (bold, italic).
- 3: 36 cpl
- 4: 42 cpl
- 5: 51 cpl
- 6: 64 cpl

It seems more versatile to create different words to switch the modes
on and provide a common user interface to row, column, cpl, window...
