== Description

// tag::description[]

Solo Forth is a Forth system for the ZX Spectrum 128 and
compatible computers, with disk drives and +3DOS, G+DOS, or TR-DOS.

Solo Forth cannot run on the original ZX Spectrum 48, but could be
used to develop programs for it.

Solo Forth can be used as a stand-alone Forth system (either on an
emulator or on the real computer), or as part of a cross-development
environment on a GNU/Linux operating system (in theory, other type of
operating systems could be used as well).

// end::description[]

=== Main features

// tag::mainfeatures[]

- Fast DTC (Direct Threaded Code) implementation.
- A kernel as small as possible.
- Name space in banked memory, separated from code and data space.
- Easy access to banked memory.
- Big <<_library,library>> of useful source code.
- Modular <<_platforms,DOS support>>.
- Fully documented source code.
- Detailed documentation.
- Conform to the http://forth-standard.org[Forth
  standard,role="external"] (not fully tested yet).

// end::mainfeatures[]

=== Minimum requirements

// XXX REMARK -- These are generic requirements. The manual contains
// more details, depending on the DOS.

- 128 KiB RAM.
- One double-sided 80-track disk drive (two or three recommended,
  depending on the DOS).

== Motivation, history and current status

// tag::history[]

The motivation behind Solo Forth is double:

1. *I wanted to program the ZX Spectrum with a modern Forth system*:
   In 2015, my
   http://programandala.net/en.program.abersoft_forth.html[detailed
   disassembly of ZX Spectrum's Abersoft Forth], a popular tape-based
   implementation of fig-Forth ported to several 8-bit home computers
   in the 1980's (and the Forth system I started learning Forth with
   in 1984), helped me understand the inner working of the fig-Forth
   model, including its by-design limitations, compared to modern
   Forths, and discover some bugs of the ZX Spectrum port. At the same time I
   wrote the http://programandala.net/en.program.afera.html[Afera
   library] in order to make Abersoft Forth more stable, powerful and
   comfortable for cross development.
   The objective was reached but, after a
   certain point, further improvements weren't feasible without making
   radical changes in the system. The need for a new Forth system
   arised: a Forth designed from the start to use disk drives and
   banked memory, and useful for cross-development.

2. *Nobody had written such a Forth system before:* In 2015 there was
   no disk-based Forth for the ZX Spectrum platform, and the only
   Forth written for ZX Spectrum 128 (the first model with banked
   memory) was Lennart Benschop's Forth-83
   (1988). But despite being more powerful than fig-Forth, it is still
   tape-based and keeps the block sources in a RAM disk. Beside, the
   system is built by metacompilation, what makes it difficult to
   adapt to disk drives.

The development of Solo Forth started on 2015-05-30, from the
disassembled code of Abersoft Forth. Some ideas and code were reused
also from the Afera library and from a previous abandoned project
called http://programandala.net/en.program.dzx-forth.html[DZX-Forth]
(a port of CP/M DX-Forth to ZX Spectrum +3e).

The http://github.com/programandala-net/solo-forth[GitHub
repository,role="external"] was created on 2016-03-13 from the
development backups, in order to preserve the evolution of the code
from the very beginning. On 2020-12-05 the repository was converted
from Git to http://fossil-scm.org[Fossil]. GitHub will be used only as
a mirror.

Solo Forth is very stable, and it's being used to develop two projects
in Forth:
http://programandala.net/en.program.nuclear_waste_invaders.html[Nuclear
Waste Invaders] and
http://programandala.net/en.program.black_flag.html[Black Flag].
