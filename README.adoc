== Description

// tag::description[]

Solo Forth is a standard Forth system for the ZX Spectrum 128 and
compatible computers, with disk drives and +3DOS, G+DOS, or TR-DOS.

Solo Forth can not run on the original ZX Spectrum 48, but could be
used to develop programs for it.

Solo Forth can be used as a stand-alone Forth system (either on an
emulator or on the real computer), or as part of a cross-development
environment on a GNU/Linux operating system (in theory, other type of
operating systems could be used as well).

// end::description[]

=== Main features

// tag::mainfeatures[]

- Fast DTC (Direct Threaded Code) implementation.
- A kernel as small as possible.
- Name space in banked memory, separated from code and data space.
- Transparent access to banked memory.
- Big <<_library,library>> of useful source code.
- Modular <<_platforms,DOS support>>.
- Fully documented source code.
- Detailed documentation.
- Conform to the http://forth-standard.org[Forth
  standard,role="external"] (not fully tested yet).

// end::mainfeatures[]

=== Minimum requirements

// XXX REMARK -- These are generic requirements. The manual contains
// more details, depending on the DOS.

- 128 KiB RAM.
- One double-sided 80-track disk drive (two or three recommended,
  depending on the DOS).

== Motivation, history and current status

// tag::history[]

The motivation behind Solo Forth is double:

1. *I wanted to program the ZX Spectrum with a modern Forth system*:
   In 2015, my
   http://programandala.net/en.program.abersoft_forth.html[detailed
   disassembly of ZX Spectrum's Abersoft Forth], a popular tape-based
   implementation of fig-Forth ported to several 8-bit home computers
   in the 1980's (and the Forth system I started learning Forth with
   in 1984), helped me understand the inner working of the fig-Forth
   model, including its by-design limitations, compared to modern
   Forths, and discover some bugs of the ZX Spectrum port. Then I
   wrote the http://programandala.net/en.program.afera.html[Afera
   library] in order to make Abersoft Forth more stable, powerful and
   comfortable for cross development.  In fact both projects were
   parallel for months. The objective was reached but, after a
   certain point, further improvements weren't feasible without making
   radical changes in the system. The need for a new Forth system
   arised: a Forth designed from the start to use disk drives and
   banked memory, and useful for cross-development.

2. *Nobody had written such a Forth system before:* In 2015 there was
   no disk-based Forth for the ZX Spectrum platform, and the only
   Forth written for ZX Spectrum 128, the first model with banked
   memory, was Lennart Benschop's Forth-83
   (1988). But despite being more powerful than fig-Forth, it is still
   tape-based and keeps the block sources in a RAM disk. Beside, the
   system is built by metacompilation, what makes it difficult to
   adapt to disk drives.

The development of Solo Forth started on 2015-05-30, from the
disassembled code of Abersoft Forth. Some ideas and code were reused
also from the Afera library and from a previous abandoned project
called http://programandala.net/en.program.dzx-forth.html[DZX-Forth]
(a port of CP/M DX-Forth to ZX Spectrum +3e).

The http://github.com/programandala-net/solo-forth[GitHub
repository,role="external"] was created on 2016-03-13 from the
development backups, in order to preserve the evolution of the code
from the very beginning.

Solo Forth is very stable, and it's being used to develop two projects
in Forth:
http://programandala.net/en.program.nuclear_waste_invaders.html[Nuclear
Waste Invaders] and
http://programandala.net/en.program.black_flag.html[Black Flag].

Porting the G+DOS version of Solo Forth to its close relatives GDOS,
Beta DOS and Uni-DOS would require only minor changes, beside adding
some library code to support their specific features.

   uses keyboard tokens, like the ZX Spectrum 48, but commands typed
   in 'L' cursor mode will be recognized as well, as on the ZX

   type a quote (Symbol Shift + 'P') or press 'E' to get keyword
   ``REM``. When the DOS command is typed in full, the quote or the
   ``REM`` must be removed from the start of the line before pressing
