== Description

Solo Forth is a modern http://forth-standard.org[standard
Forth,role="external"] system under development for the ZX Spectrum
128 and compatible computers, with disk drives.

Solo Forth can not run on the original ZX Spectrum 48, but it may be
used to develop Forth programs for that machine.

Solo Forth can be used as a stand-alone Forth system on a ZX Spectrum
emulator or the real computer. Nevertheless, its goal is the cross
development of Forth programs using a ZX Spectrum emulator on a
GNU/Linux operating system (in theory, other type of operating system
could be used as well).

.Minimum requirements
- 128 KiB RAM
- One double-sided 80-track disk drive (two
  recommended).

.Main features
- Fast DTC (Direct Threaded Code) implementation.
- A kernel as small as possible.
- Name space in banked memory, separated from code and data space.
- Transparent access to banked memory.
- Big <<_library,library>> of useful source code.
- Modular <<_platforms,DOS support>>.
- Fully documented source code.
- Detailed documentation.

== History and current status

The development of Solo Forth started on 2015-05-30, from the
http://programandala.net/en.program.abersoft_forth.html[disassembled
code of Abersoft Forth], a tape-based fig-Forth 1.1 for ZX Spectrum
48.

The http://github.com/programandala-net/solo-forth[GitHub
repository,role="external"] was created on 2016-03-13 from the
development backups, in order to preserve the change history from the
very beginning.  Besides, there's a
http://programandala.net/en.program.solo_forth.history.html[development
history until v0.12.0 (2016-12-31)].

At the time of writing, Solo Forth is under active development. It's
very stable, and it's being used to develop two projects in Forth:
http://programandala.net/en.program.nuclear_waste_invaders.html[Nuclear
Waste Invaders] and
http://programandala.net/en.program.black_flag.html[Black Flag].

Porting the G+DOS version of Solo Forth to its close relatives GDOS,
Beta DOS and Uni-DOS would require only minor changes, beside adding
some library code to support their specific features.

- Disk 0 is the boot disk. It contains the BASIC loader, the Solo
  Forth binary, some addons (i.e. compiled code that is not part of
  the library yet) and fonts for the supported screen modes.  Several
  TR-DOS disk images are included, for specific models of Pentagon and
  Scorpion computers (in a future version, one single disk will
  contain all the executables, and the right one will be selected
  automatically).
- Disk 1 contains the library. Since TR-DOS disks are only 640 KiB,
  its library is splitted into two disks: 1a and 1b.
- Disk 2 contains some programs: little sample games, most of them
  under development, two block editors and one sound editor.
- Disk 3 contains tests and benchmarks. Most of them were used during
  the development and their only documentation is the commented
  source.

WARNING: Disks 1, 2 and 3 are Forth block disks: They contain the
source Forth blocks directly on the disk sectors, without any file
system.  Therefore their contents can not be accessed with ordinary
DOS commands.

   type a quote (Symbol Shift + 'P') or press 'E' to get keyword

// Documentation {{{1
== Documentation

The <doc> directory contains one version of the manual for every DOS
supported, in HTML and PDF formats.

The manual, which is automatically built from the library and other
files, is a work in progress. At the moment it contains only a
description of the Forth system, the basic information required to use
it and a complete glossary with cross references.

The following improvements are planned for a future version:

- A reference guide by subject, e.g. graphics, sound, blocks, files,
  control flow structures, etc.
- A description of the library modules.

NOTE: Glossary cross references to Forth words that contain a
backslash, or that are included in code examples, are corrupted. This
problem will be fixed in a future version.
