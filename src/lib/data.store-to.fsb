  \ History

  \ 2016-05-10: First version.
  \
  \ 2016-05-17: Need `>body`, which has been moved to the
  \ library.
  \
  \ 2016-11-17: Update documentation with `const`, `cconst` and
  \ `2const`.
  \
  \ 2016-11-18: Add missing references to `const`, `cconst` and
  \ `2const` in documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-02-17: Update cross references and improve
  \ documentation.

  \ Compilation: ( "name" -- )
  \
  \ Parse _name_, which is a word created by `constant` or
  \ `const`, and append the execution execution semantics given
  \ below to the current definition.
  \
  \ Execution: ( x -- )

  \ Make _x_ the current value of constant _name_.
