  \ History

  \ 2015-11-13: Modified `.depth` to print a signed number,
  \ better for debugging.
  \
  \ 2016-04-12: Divided into 3 blocks, in order to reuse
  \ `.depth` for the floating point `.fs`. Fixed the check: the
  \ stacks are not printed when their depth is negative.
  \
  \ 2016-04-24: Remove `[char]`, which has been moved to the
  \ library.
  \
  \ 2016-12-30: Compact the code, saving two blocks. Make
  \ `.depth` 4 bytes smaller.
  \
  \ 2017-01-18: Remove `exit` at the end of conditional
  \ interpretation.
  \
  \ 2017-01-25: Add deferred `(.s)` to `.s` and rewrite `u.s`
  \ after `.s`.
  \
  \ 2017-02-20: Replace `do`, which has been moved to the
  \ library, with `?do`.
