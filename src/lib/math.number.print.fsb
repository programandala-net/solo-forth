  \ Latest changes

  \ 2016-05-01: Add `holds`.
  \
  \ 2016-11-24: Move `u.r` from the kernel and document it.
  \ Document also `ud.r` and `ud.`. Improve individual needing
  \ of all of them.
  \
  \ 2016-12-08: Fix `u.r`. Fix needing of `ud.`.
  \
  \ 2016-12-30: Compact the code, saving one block.
  \
  \ 2017-01-18: Remove `exit` at the end of conditional
  \ interpretation.
  \
  \ 2017-01-19: Remove remaining `exit` at the end of
  \ conditional interpretation. Rename `(d.)` to `(d.`,
  \ `(dbin.)` to `(dbin.` and `(dhex.)` to `(dhex.`.  Make all
  \ words individually accessible to `need`.
  \
  \ 2017-02-19: Replace `do`, which has been moved to the
  \ library, with `?do`.
