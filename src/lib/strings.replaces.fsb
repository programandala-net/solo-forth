  \ replaces  ( ca1 len1 ca2 len2 -- )

  \ Set the string _ca1 len1_ as the text to substitute for
  \ the substitution named by _ca2 len2_. If the substitution
  \ does not exist it is created. The  program may then reuse
  \ the buffer _ca1 len1_ without affecting the definition  of
  \ the substitution.

  \ Ambiguous conditions occur as follows:

  \   * The substitution cannot be created;
  \   * The name of a substitution contains the "%" delimiter character.

  \ `replaces` may allot  data space and  create a definition.
  \ This breaks  the contiguity of  the current region  and is
  \ not allowed during compilation of a colon definition
