  \ Description

  \ Tools to translate programs, i.e. to create and handle text
  \ strings, characters and code in several languages, and use
  \ them automatically depending on the current language
  \ selected by the user.

  \ ===========================================================
  \ Change log

  \ 2019-03-14: Start. Move the code of `localized-string`,
  \ `localized-word` and `localized-character` from project
  \ _Nuclear Waste Invaders_
  \ (http://programandala.net/en.program.nuclear_waste_invaders.html).
  \
  \ 2019-03-15: Improve documentation and needing. Add
  \ `far-localized-string`, `localized,`,
  \ `far>localized-string`.
  \
  \ 2020-06-08: Fix `far-localized,`. Document `localized,` and
  \ `far-localized,`. Make `far-localized,` accessible, even if
  \ it's not used yet.
  \
  \ 2020-06-16: Fix typo.
