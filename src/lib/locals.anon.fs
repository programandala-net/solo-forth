  \ Description

  \ An implementation of locals using an array of anonymous
  \ variables.

( anon )

need array>

variable anon> ( -- a )

  \ doc{
  \
  \ anon>  ( -- a ) "anon-to"
  \
  \ A `variable`. _a_ contains the address of the buffer used by
  \ local variables defined by `set-anon` and accessed by
  \ `anon`.
  \
  \ ``anon>`` must be set by the application before compiling a
  \ word that uses `set-anon` and `anon`.  One single buffer
  \ pointed by ``anon>`` can be shared by several words,
  \ provided they dont't need to use it at the same time, e.g.
  \ because of nesting.

: anon \ Compilation: ( n -- ) Run-time: ( -- a )
  anon> @ array> postpone literal ; immediate compile-only

  \ doc{
  \
  \ anon
  \   Compilation:  ( n -- )
  \   Run-time:     ( -- a )

  \ ``anon`` is an `immediate` and `compile-only` word.
  \
  \ Compilation:
  \
  \ Compile a reference to cell _n_ (0 index) of the buffer
  \ pointed by `anon>` and initialized by `set-anon`.
  \
  \ Run-time:
  \
  \ Return address _a_ of cell _n_ (0 index) of the buffer that
  \ was pointed by `anon>` during the compilation.
  \
  \ See `set-anon` for a usage example.
  \
  \ See: `arguments`, `local`.

: set-anon ( x#n ... x#1 n -- )
  cells anon> @ swap bounds ?do i ! cell +loop ;

  \ doc{
  \
  \ set-anon ( x#n ... x#1 n -- )
  \
  \ Store the given _n_ cells into the buffer pointed by
  \ `anon>`, which will be accessed by `anon`.
  \
  \ Usage example:

  \ ----
  \ here anon> ! 5 cells allot
  \
  \ : test ( x4 x3 x2 x1 x0 -- )
  \   5 set-anon
  \   [ 0 ] anon ?     \ display _x0_
  \   123 [ 0 ] anon !
  \   [ 0 ] anon ?     \ display 123
  \   [ 2 ] anon ?     \ display _x2_
  \   555 [ 2 ] anon !
  \   [ 2 ] anon ?     \ display 555
  \   ;
  \ ----
