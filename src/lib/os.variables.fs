  \
  \ os-chars ( -- a ) "o-s-chars"
  \

  \ CHARS, which holds the bitmap address of character 0 of the
  \ current font (actual characters 32..127). By default this
  \ system variables holds ROM address 15360 ($3C00).

  \ variable CHANS, which holds the address of the channel data
  \ table. Each element of the table has the following

  \ from `os-strms` by 1-indexed byte offsets, i.e. $0001
  \ points to the first element of the channel data table,
  \ channel 'K'.
