  \ Push an exception frame on the exception stack and then

  \ is executed during the execution of _xt_.
  \
  \ If the execution of _xt_ completes normally (i.e., the
  \ exception frame pushed by this `catch` is not popped by an
  \ execution of `throw`) pop the exception frame and return
  \ zero on top of the data stack, above whatever stack items
  \ would have been returned by the execution of _xt_.
  \ Otherwise, the remainder of the execution semantics are
  \ given by `throw`.

  \ Change log

  \ 2015-09: Main development.
  \
  \ 2015-10: Fixes.
  \
  \ 2016-04-14: Restored the file from the repository. It was
  \ removed from version 0.3.0+2016-04-09 by mistake. Updated
  \ the headers and documentation.  Renamed `(.throw)` to
  \ `.throw-message`, and `msg-scr` to `error-messages-block`.
  \ Fixed `error>ordinal`.
  \
  \ 2016-04-25: Add carriage return before the exception
  \ message in `.throw-message`.
  \
  \ 2016-04-29: Add `warning"`.
  \
  \ 2016-05-03: Document `warning"`.
  \
  \ 2016-08-05: Rename `error-messages-block` to
  \ `errors-block`. Combine blocks to save two of them.
  \
  \ 2016-11-26: Move `catch` from the kernel.
  \
  \ 2017-01-13: Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-01-18: Remove `exit` at the end of conditional
  \ interpretation.
  \
  \ 2017-01-19: Remove remaining `exit` at the end of
  \ conditional interpretation, after `immediate` or
  \ `compile-only`.
  \
  \ 2017-01-20: Fix `error>ordinal`: error code #-286 was added
  \ some days ago, making #-300 the new highest code available
  \ for system error codes, but `error>ordinal` wasn't updated.
  \
  \ 2017-02-17: Update notation "behaviour" to "action".
  \
  \ 2017-05-05: Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-05-07: Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-12-08: Update source style (spacing). Improve
  \ documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-12-09: Remove optional definition of `abort-message`,
  \ which is defined in the kernel.
  \
  \ 2018-02-04: Improve documentation: add pronunciation to
  \ words that need it.
  \
  \ 2018-03-05: Update `[unneeded]` to `unneeding`.
  \
  \ 2018-04-15: Update notation ".." to "...".
  \
  \ 2018-06-04: Update: remove trailing closing paren from
  \ word names.
