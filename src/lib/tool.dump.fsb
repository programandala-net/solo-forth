  \ Latest changes

  \ 2016-04-15: Fixed `dump` (the loop printed one byte more
  \ than requested). Improved `ascii-type` (now also characters
  \ above 127 are printed as dots, not masked).
  \
  \ 2016-04-24: Fix `dump`: nothing was printed when length was
  \ less than 8.
  \
  \ 2016-04-27: Move `ascii-char?` and `control-char?` to
  \ module "chars.fsb".  Move `ascii-type` to module
  \ "printing.type.fsb" and rename it to `type-ascii`. Replace
  \ `bs` with `backspace`, which is part of the library.

( dump )

need 16hex.  need type-ascii  need backspace

: dump  ( ca len -- )
  8 max 8 2dup mod - + 8 / 1- 0
  ?do
    cr dup 16hex.
    8 0 do  i over + @ flip 16hex.  cell +loop
    dup backspace 8 type-ascii
    break-key? ?leave
  8 + loop  drop  ;
  \ Show the contents of _n_ bytes starting from _ca_.

( wdump )

need 16hex.

: wdump  ( a n -- )
  \ Show the contents of _n_ cells starting from _a_.
  0
  ?do
    i 4 mod 0= if  cr dup 16hex. space  then  \ show address
    dup @ 16hex. cell+
    break-key? ?leave
  loop  drop  ;
