  \ Latest changes

  \ 2016-04-15: Fixed `dump` (the loop printed one byte more
  \ than requested). Improved `ascii-type` (now also characters
  \ above 127 are printed as dots, not masked).
  \
  \ 2016-04-24: Fix `dump`: nothing was printed when length was
  \ less than 8.
  \
  \ 2016-04-27: Move `ascii-char?` and `control-char?` to
  \ module "chars.fsb".  Move `ascii-type` to module
  \ "printing.type.fsb" and rename it to `type-ascii`. Replace
  \ `bs` with `backspace`, which is part of the library.
  \
  \ 2016-11-16: Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2016-11-26: Need `?leave`, which has been moved to the
  \ library.
