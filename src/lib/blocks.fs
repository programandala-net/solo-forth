  \ ===========================================================
  \ Change log

  \ 2015..2016: Main development.
  \
  \ 2016-04-29: Add `lineload` and `lineblock>source`.
  \
  \ 2016-05-02: Join two blocks to save space.
  \
  \ 2016-05-13: Add `load-app`.
  \
  \ 2016-10-04: Start a new version of `load-app`, compatible
  \ with `[if]` and other words that use `refill`.
  \
  \ 2016-10-11: Finish the new version of `load-app`,
  \ compatible with `[if]` and other words that use `refill`.
  \
  \ 2016-11-21: Move `.line` to <tool.list.blocks.fsb>.
  \
  \ 2016-11-26: Rename `blocks` to `blk/disk` after the fix in
  \ the kernel.
  \
  \ 2016-11-27: Use `lastblk` in `reload`, instead of `scr`.
  \
  \ 2017-02-16: Remove `?\`, which is in the kernel.
  \
  \ 2017-02-17: Update cross references.  Change markup of
  \ inline code that is not a cross reference.
  \
  \ 2017-02-20: Replace `do`, which has been moved to the
  \ library, with `?do`.
  \
  \ 2017-02-27: Improve documentation.

  \ 2017-03-13: Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-04-01: Fix documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-05-08: Rename `load-app` to `load-program`, and so the
  \ related words. Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-05-22: Factor `load-program` into `(load-program`, to
  \ make it possible to continue loading from a block, in case
  \ of error. Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-09-09: Update notation "pfa" to the standard "dfa".
  \
  \ 2018-02-05: Improve documentation: add pronunciation to
  \ words that need it.
