  \ ~~quit-key ( -- ca ) "tilde-tilde-quit-key"
  \
  \ A character variable. _ca_ is the address of a character

  \ points compiled by `~~`. If its value is not zero,

  \ contains zero, `~~control` will not wait for a key.  If
  \ ``~~resume-key`` contains $FF, `~~control` will wait for
  \ any key.  Otherwise `~~control` will wait for the key
  \ stored at ``~~resume-key``, whose default value is `bl`,
  \ the code of the space character.

  \ ===========================================================
  \ Change log

  \ 2016-02-18: First version.
  \
  \ 2016-11-14: Document all words. Use `defer!`, which is the
  \ kernel, instead of `is`, which is in the library.
  \
  \ 2016-11-25: Add a pause control with a configurable key to
  \ resume. Update and improve documentation. Convert the
  \ default actions of `~~save` and `~~restore` to named words,
  \ in order to make them easier to reuse.
  \
  \ 2016-11-29: Improve `~~control` to wait for any key when
  \ `~~resume-key` is less than zero. This makes it possible to
  \ debug some kind of programs without interfering with the
  \ key presses accepted by them.
  \
  \ 2016-12-03: Improve stack comments of `~~`. Rename `~~show`
  \ to `~~info`.
  \
  \ 2016-12-04: Add `~~app-info`. Need `.s` (it's still in the
  \ kernel, but only during development).
  \
  \ 2016-12-24: Improve `~~info` to produce clearer output.
  \ Set default quit and resume keys: `q` and space. Remove
  \ `~~x`, which is not useful because two full lines are used.
  \
  \ 2017-01-17: Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-02-17: Update notation "behaviour" to "action".
  \ Update cross references.
  \
  \ 2017-02-27: Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-03-13: Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-03-16: Convert cell variables to character variables.
  \ Change the behaviour of `~~control`: check if
  \ `~~resume-key` contains $FF instead of a negative value.
  \ Update and improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-12-09: Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2018-03-09: Add words' pronunciaton.
  \
  \ 2018-04-11: Update notation "double variable" to
  \ "double-cell variable".
  \
  \ 2018-04-14. Fix documentation.
