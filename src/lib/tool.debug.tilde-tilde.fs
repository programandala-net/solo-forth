  \ debugging.  Its default value is the code of 'q'.

  \ ``~~resume-key`` contains $FF, `~~control` will wait for
  \ any key.  Otherwise `~~control` will wait for the key

  \ ===========================================================
  \ Change log

  \ 2016-02-18: First version.
  \
  \ 2016-11-14: Document all words. Use `defer!`, which is the
  \ kernel, instead of `is`, which is in the library.
  \
  \ 2016-11-25: Add a pause control with a configurable key to
  \ resume. Update and improve documentation. Convert the
  \ default actions of `~~save` and `~~after-info` to named
  \ words, in order to make them easier to reuse.
  \
  \ 2016-11-29: Improve `~~control` to wait for any key when
  \ `~~resume-key` is less than zero. This makes it possible to
  \ debug some kind of programs without interfering with the
  \ key presses accepted by them.
  \
  \ 2016-12-03: Improve stack comments of `~~`. Rename `~~show`
  \ to `~~info`.
  \
  \ 2016-12-04: Add `~~app-info`. Need `.s` (it's still in the
  \ kernel, but only during development).
  \
  \ 2016-12-24: Improve `~~info` to produce clearer output. Set
  \ default quit and resume keys: `q` and space. Remove `~~x`,
  \ which is not useful because two full lines are used.
  \
  \ 2017-01-17: Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-02-17: Update notation "behaviour" to "action". Update
  \ cross references.
  \
  \ 2017-02-27: Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-03-13: Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-03-16: Convert cell variables to character variables.
  \ Change the behaviour of `~~control`: check if
  \ `~~resume-key` contains $FF instead of a negative value.
  \ Update and improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-12-09: Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2018-03-09: Add words' pronunciaton.
  \
  \ 2018-04-11: Update notation "double variable" to
  \ "double-cell variable".
  \
  \ 2018-04-14: Fix documentation.
  \
  \ 2018-06-04: Update: remove trailing closing paren from word
  \ names. Link `variable` and `2variable` in documentation.
  \
  \ 2019-03-18: Rename `~~save` `~~before-info`. Rename
  \ `~~restore` `~~after-info`. Remove `~~app-info` and make
  \ `~~info` deferred: this is simpler and equally
  \ configurable. Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2020-05-04: Fix cross reference in `(~~`.
  \
  \ 2020-05-08: Update requirements: `.name` has been moved
  \ from the kernel to the library.
  \
  \ 2020-05-19: Update: `2variable` has been moved to the
  \ library.
  \
  \ 2020-06-15: Improve documentation: Add cross-references to
  \ `cvariable`; replace "This is" with the corresponding word.
