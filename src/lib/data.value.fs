  \ ``to`` is an `immediate` word.
  \
  \ Interpretation:
  \
  \ Parse _name_, which is a word created by `cvalue`, `value`
  \ or `2value`, and make _i*x_ its value.
  \
  \ Compilation:
  \
  \ Parse _name_, which is a word created by `cvalue`, `value`
  \ or `2value`, and append the execution execution semantics
  \ given below to the current definition.
  \
  \ Run-time:
  \
  \ Make _i*x_ the value of _name_.
