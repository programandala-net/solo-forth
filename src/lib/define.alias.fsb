  \ Description

  \ Implementation of `alias`.  Features of an alias defined with
  \ `alias`:
  \
  \ - It has the execution token of the original word.
  \ - It does not inherit the attributes of the original word,
  \   which can be set with `immediate` and `compile-only`.
  \ - It does not use data space memory.
  \ - It can be reconfigured with `realias` and `alias!`, but
  \   the compiled aliases don't change.

  \ History

  \ 2015-10-25: First version of `alias`: it creates a deferred
  \ word and initializes it. Second version: it recognizes code
  \ words and patches their code field instead.
  \
  \ 2015-12-26: New alternative version, adapted to DTC: if
  \ _xt_ is a deferred word, the alias will point to the word
  \ it's associated to.
  \
  \ 2016-02-27: Fixed the DTC version: the alias of an
  \ unitialized deferred word executed the default error even
  \ after the initialization of the deferred word.
  \
  \ 2016-03-04: Removed the ITC version.
  \
  \ 2016-04-17: Improved `alias`: nowe the aliases have the xt
  \ of the original word.
  \
  \ 2016-04-18: Wrote `realias`.
  \
  \ 2016-04-29: Add `alias!`, a useful common factor of
  \ `alias` and `realias`.
  \
  \ 2016-05-05: Add conditional compilation. Improve
  \ documentation.
  \
  \ 2016-10-28: Adapt `alias!` to the extra-memory system.
  \
  \ 2016-11-13: Update the names of far-memory words.
  \
  \ 2016-11-18: Improve documentation of `alias`.
  \
  \ 2017-01-05: Remove old system bank support from `alias!`.
  \
  \ 2017-01-18: Remove `exit` at the end of conditional
  \ interpretation.
