  \ History

  \ 2015..2016: Main development.
  \
  \ 2016-04-11: Documented.
  \
  \ 2016-05-01: Update.
  \
  \ 2016-05-02: Join two blocks to save space.
  \
  \ 2016-05-05: Remove unnecessary `space` from `.wid`.
  \
  \ 2016-05-06: Improve printing of nameless word lists.
  \
  \ 2016-11-17: Use `?(` instead of `[if]`.
  \
  \ 2017-01-06: Make all words independent to `need`. Fix and
  \ finish `wordlists`.
  \
  \ 2017-01-07: Update `wid>name` to `wordlist>name @`,
  \ `wid>link` to `wordlist>link`,  and `wid>vocabulary` to
  \ `wordlist>vocabulary`, after the changes in the word-list
  \ interface words. Rename `.wid` to `.wordlist`.  Rename
  \ `named-wid` to `latest>wordlist` in documentation.
