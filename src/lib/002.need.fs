  \ Description

  \ The `need` utility which manages the code dependencies.
  \ For convenience it is in block 2.
  \
  \ The utility consists of words `need`, `needed`, `reneed`
  \ and `reneeded`. All of them are deferred words. Their
  \ default action is set by `use-no-index`: locate the
  \ required word searching a configurable range of blocks.
  \
  \ Alternative actions are provided by the optional tools
  \ Thru Indexer and Fly Indexer.

  \ ===========================================================
  \ Change log

  \ 2015-06: First version, partly based on code from Afera.
  \
  \ 2015-06-25: Fix: `require` and `locate` needed to save the
  \ parsed words to the circular string buffer.
  \
  \ 2015-09-13: Rename `require` to `need`, and all related
  \ words accordingly.  The reason is `require` and `required`
  \ are standard words (in Forth-94 and Forth-2012), and should
  \ not be used for different purposes.
  \
  \ 2015-10-05: Fix `needed`. The trailing and leading spaces
  \ of the string, sometimes used to prevent name clashes, had
  \ to be removed before `undefined?`. `-leading` has to be
  \ moved to the kernel.
  \
  \ 2015-10-16: Add `[needed]`.  It allows selective
  \ compilation depending on the word specified by `need` or
  \ `needed`.  Improve `located`: now the string searched for
  \ is delimited with spaces. This prevents name clashes and
  \ makes it unnecessary to add the spaces explicitly in risky
  \ cases.
  \
  \ 2015-10-25: Improve `need` and `needed` a bit.
  \
  \ 2016-04-02: Factor `new-needed-word` from `needed`.  This
  \ change was needed for `indexer`.
  \
  \ 2016-04-03: Make `need` and related words deferred. Factor
  \ `new-needed-word` from `needed`. These changes were needed
  \ for `indexer`.
  \
  \ 2016-04-26: Improve `located`: when the user press the
  \ break key, throw exception #-28 ("user interrupt");
  \ formerly the ordinary #-268 ("required, but not located")
  \ was thrown by the calling word.
  \
  \ 2016-05-06: Make `from` and `locate` optional. Compact the
  \ blocks.
  \
  \ 2016-05-07: Improve documentation. Fix the word shown when
  \ `?locate` throws an error.
  \
  \ 2016-05-10: Fix a harmless bug: `locate-reneed` called the
  \ deferred `reneeded` instead of `locate-reneeded`.
  \
  \ 2016-05-31: Fix block header.
  \
  \ 2016-06-01: Fix `need-here`, which left the string on the
  \ stack.
  \
  \ 2016-10-28: Add a temporary debugging informer to
  \ `located`.
  \
  \ 2016-11-19: Add `unlocated` in order to implement
  \ `fly-indexer`. Improve the documentation.
  \
  \ 2016-11-21: Document why `contains` is not accessible here,
  \ and therefore it's defined also in the strings module.
  \
  \ 2016-11-24: Rename some words to be consistent with the
  \ changes in the Thru Index and the Fly Index.  Factor
  \ `use-no-index`. Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2016-11-25: Factor `use-no-index`, `use-default-located`.
  \ Fix and improve documentation and names.
  \
