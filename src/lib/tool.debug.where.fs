  \ Change log

  \ 2016-04-21: 3 bytes shorter.
  \
  \ 2016-04-24: Remove `[char]`, which has been moved to the
  \ library.
  \
  \ 2016-11-17: Remove unused `need [if]`.
  \
  \ 2017-01-18: The temporary version in the kernel has been
  \ removed. Improve documentation. Simplify: do not update
  \ `scr`.
  \
  \ 2017-01-26: Fix stack underflow. Change title to "Block"
  \ and print its number as unsigned (no practical difference
  \ when using floppy disks, but block numbers are unsigned).
  \
  \ 2017-02-17: Update cross references.
  \
  \ 2017-05-07: Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2018-09-24: Improve documentation. Simplify with `dec.`.
