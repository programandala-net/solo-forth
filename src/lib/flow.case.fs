  \ Change log

  \ 2016-04-24: Add `need pick`, because `pick` has been moved
  \ from the kernel to the library.
  \
  \ 2016-05-06: Replace two remaining `[compile]` with
  \ `postpone`.
  \
  \ 2016-08-05: Compact the code to save some blocks.
  \
  \ 2016-11-16: Update the space used by every version. Make
  \ the default version of `case` use `alias` if it's already
  \ defined.
  \
  \ 2017-01-19: Remove `exit` at the end of conditional
  \ interpretation.
  \
  \ 2017-03-17: Use `cconstant` instead of `constant`. Update
  \ style of stack comments. Remove all alternative
  \ implementations of `case`. Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-03-19: Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-11-27: Improve documentation. Fix needing of
  \ `greater-of`. Need `nup` instead of define it. Use `thens`
  \ in `endcase`. Test `within-of`.
  \
  \ 2017-12-09: Remove optional usage of `alias` to define
  \ `case` and `endof`, since `[defined]` is moved to the
  \ library.
  \
  \ 2017-12-10: Improve documentation.
