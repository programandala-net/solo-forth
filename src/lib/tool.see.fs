  \ (adaptative version by EHR), modified by Dennis L. Wilson.

  \ ===========================================================
  \ Change log

  \ 2015-06-05: Copied from Afera. First changes to adapt it.
  \
  \ 2015-06-19: Added `?branch`.
  \
  \ 2015-07-23: Fix: `clit` was not included in the recognized
  \ special cases.
  \
  \ 2015-08-14: Fixed a recent bug: `sp0 sp!` was used when
  \ quitting, instead of `sp0 @ sp!`!
  \
  \ 2015-10-09: Fix: `slit` was missing from the special cases.
  \
  \ 2015-12-21: Fixed `decode-special` after the Forth-83
  \ version of `do loop`: now the branch address is after `do`
  \ or `?do`; also added `-branch` to it, in case it is already
  \ defined during the compilation of `decode-special`.
  \
  \ 2015-12-24: Start converting from ITC to DTC.
  \
  \ 2016-04-15: Fixed `decode-compile`, which had not been
  \ adapted from ITC to DTC.
  \
  \ 2016-04-17: Added the requisite of `recurse`, which is not
  \ in the kernel anymore. Updated the history from the
  \ development history of the project.
  \
  \ 2016-04-24: Add support for `2lit`.
  \
  \ 2016-04-24: Remove `[char]`, which has been moved to the
  \ library.
  \
  \ 2016-05-17: Need `>body` and `body>`, which has been moved
  \ to the library.
  \
  \ 2016-05-18: Improve `colon-cfa?`. Compact `decode-special`.
  \ Fix `decode`, which showed the usage instructions before
  \ checking the word.
  \
  \ 2016-11-17: Remove unused `need [if]`.
  \
  \ 2016-11-23: Rename `decode` to `see`; rename all words and
  \ the module accordingly. Compact the code, saving one block.
  \ Document the interface words.
  \
  \ 2016-11-24: Add `see-xt` and `see-body-from`. Make them
  \ individually accessible for `need`.
  \
  \ 2016-12-03: Preserve the compilation wordlist and the
  \ search order. Useful when the tool is needed during the
  \ development of a program.
  \
  \ 2017-01-06: Fix: the compilation word list was left on the
  \ stack. Improve: also `see-body-from` and `see-xt` are
  \ compiled in the Forth word list.
  \
  \ 2017-01-18: Type compiled strings between quotes. This is
  \ useful when they have leading or trailing spaces.
  \
  \ 2017-02-17: Update cross references.
  \
  \ 2017-03-13: Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2017-03-17: Support `(abort")`, provided it is defined when
  \ `see` is compiled.
  \
  \ 2017-09-09: Update notation "pfa" to the standard "dfa".
  \
  \ 2017-12-09: Need `[undefined]`, which is moved to the
  \ library.
  \
  \ 2017-12-12: Need `>name`, which has been moved to the
  \ library.
  \
  \ 2017-12-18: Replace `>name` with `>oldest-name`.
  \
  \ 2018-01-01: Rename `see-body` `see-colon-body`.  Rename
  \ `see-body-from` `see-colon-body>`. Refactor. Remove
  \ `.see-body-name`. Recognize constants, double constants,
  \ character constants, words created by `create` and
  \ `ucreate`, deferred words and code words.
  \
  \ 2018-01-03: Replace `body>name` with `body>oname`.
  \
  \ 2018-01-04: Replace `body>oname .name` with `body>oname.`,
  \ using `>oname.` to handle unnamed colon words.
  \
  \ 2018-01-06: Start implementing `manual-see`.
  \
  \ 2018-01-07: Finish implementation of `manual-see`.
  \
  \ 2018-03-09: Add words' pronunciaton.
  \
  \ 2018-06-04: Update: remove trailing closing paren from word
  \ names. Link `variable` in documentation.
  \
  \ 2020-05-05: Improve documentation.
  \
  \ 2020-05-08: Update requirements: `.name` has been moved
  \ from the kernel to the library.
