  \ _x y_ is the new cursor position corresponding to a display
  \ mode whose `form` is _cols rows_. _x y_ are calculated with
  \ the values returned by `xy`, `columns` and `rows` in the
  \ current mode.
  \
  \ ``form>xy`` is a factor of `>form`.

: >form ( cols rows -- )

  \ doc{
  \
  \ >form ( cols rows -- )
  \
  \ Adapt the cursor position of the current display mode to a
  \ display mode whose `form` is _cols rows_.
  \
  \ ``>form`` is used by the display modes, e.g. `mode-32` and
  \ `mode-64o`.
  \
  \ NOTE: When ``>form`` is executed, the action of `at-xy`
  \ must be that of the new mode, but `xy`, `rows` and
  \ `columns` must still return the values of the current (old)
  \ mode.
  \
  \ }doc

[unneeded] form ?( need columns need rows

: form ( -- cols rows ) columns rows ; ?)

  \ doc{
  \
  \ form ( -- cols rows )
  \
  \ Number of `columns` and `rows` in the terminal in the
  \ current display mode (e.g. `mode-32`, `mode-64o`).
  \
  \ Origin: Gforth.
  \
  \ }doc

[unneeded] (at-xy
?\ : (at-xy ( col row -- ) 22 emit swap emit emit ;

  \ doc{
  \
  \ (at-xy  ( col row -- )
  \
  \ Set the cursor coordinates to column _col_ and row _row_,
  \ by displaying control character 22 followed by _col_ and
  \ _row_, as needed by some display modes, e.g. `mode-64` and
  \ `mode-42`.  The upper left corner is column zero, row zero.
  \
  \ ``(at-xy`` is a possible action of `at-xy`, which is a
  \ deferred word configured by the current display mode.

  \ WARNING: The default `mode-32` expects _row_ right after
  \ control character 22, and then _col_, i.e in the order used
  \ by Sinclair BASIC. This will be fixed/unified in a future
  \ version of Solo Forth.
  \
  \ }doc

[unneeded] columns ?\ need cvalue 32 cvalue columns

  \ doc{

  \ Return the number of columns in the current screen mode.
  \ The default value is 32.

[unneeded] rows ?\ need cvalue 24 cvalue rows

  \ doc{
  \
  \ rows ( -- n )
  \
  \ Return the number of rows in the current screen mode.  The
  \ default value is 24.

  \ ===========================================================
  \ Change log

  \ 2016-05-07: Compact the blocks.
  \
  \ 2016-05-17: Need `>body`, which has been moved to the
  \ library.
  \
  \ 2016-12-08: Rename the module filename with uppercase
  \ "COMMON", after the new convention.
  \
  \ 2016-12-20: Rename `jpnext` to `jpnext,` after the change
  \ in the kernel.
  \
  \ 2017-01-18: Make `columns` and `rows` independent for
  \ `need` and document them.  Remove `exit` at the end of
  \ conditional interpretation.
  \
  \ 2017-02-16: Remove `set-font`, which is in the kernel.
  \
  \ 2017-02-17: Update cross references.
  \
  \ 2017-03-04: Update naming convention of Z80 routines, after
  \ the changes in the kernel.
  \
  \ 2017-04-16: Improve needing of `set-mode-output`.
  \
  \ 2017-04-19: Use `cvalue` instead of `value` for `columns`
  \ and `rows`.
  \
  \ 2017-04-21: Rename module after the new convention for
  \ display modes.  Add `(at-xy`, which was called `(at-xy)`
  \ and used by `mode-42`, `mode-64` and others.
  \
  \ 2017-05-15: Add `form>xy`, `>form` and `form`.
  \
  \ 2017-07-27: Replace `jp next` with the actual macro
  \ `_jp_next` in Z80 comments.
  \
  \ 2017-09-08: Compact the code, saving one block.
