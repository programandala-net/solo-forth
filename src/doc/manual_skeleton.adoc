- 128 KiB RAM (all machines that support +3DOS have 128 KiB).
- One double-sided 80-track disk drive (two recommended), for 720-KiB disks.
  The original single-sided 40-track disk drive (173 KiB per disk
  side) of the ZX Spectrum +3 is not supported.

== About this manual

This is the {dosname} variant of the Solo Forth manual. Nevertheless, some
details about the rest of supported DOSes are included as well, when the
comparison is useful.

This manual is built automatically from the sources. It contains mainly a
<<_description,description of the Forth system>>, the basic <<_run,usage
information>> and a complete <<_glossary,glossary>> with cross references.

// Platforms {{{1

include::doc.README.linked.adoc[tags=platforms]

Porting the G+DOS version of Solo Forth to its close relatives GDOS,
Beta DOS and Uni-DOS would require only minor changes, beside adding
some library code to support their specific features.

Supporting
http://www.worldofspectrum.org/zxplus3e/technical.html[IDEDOS,role="external"],
http://www.worldofspectrum.org/residos/[ResiDOS,role="external"],
http://esxdos.org[esxDOS,role="external"] or
http://specnext.com[NextZXOS,role="external"] would let Solo Forth use
hard drives, flash cards, and a lot of memory.

== DOS support

// +3DOS {{{2
=== +3DOS

// Rationale {{{3
==== Rationale

+3DOS uses 16 KiB of banked memory, but its features and API are
excellent and very well documented.

// G+DOS {{{2
=== G+DOS

// Rationale {{{3
==== Rationale

G+DOS was the first target (in fact, the only planned target at the
beginning), and it's also the author's platform of choice to develop
projects in Solo Forth, because of its excellent features:

- Fast disk operations.
- Big disk capacity (800 KiB for Forth blocks or 780 KiB for files).
- It uses only the RAM of the Plus D interface.

// TR-DOS {{{2
=== TR-DOS

// Rationale {{{3
==== Rationale

TR-DOS is more than 5 times slower than +3DOS and G+DOS, it uses
368 bytes of RAM from the main computer memory, and the maximum
capacity of its disks is smaller (636 KiB of useful space, either for
Forth blocks or files), but it haves some interesting features:

- TR-DOS can handle 4 disk drives. This makes it an interesting choice
  in some cases. For example, to compile a program from the fourth
  drive, using the library on the second and third drives during the process,
  while reading or manipulating the files on the first drive (for
  example, graphics); or just to use a total of 2544 Forth blocks
  (``636 4 *``).
- TR-DOS is used by Pentagon and Scorpion, the powerful Russian clones
  of ZX Spectrum.

// The DSK disk image format {{{2
=== The DSK disk image format

The DSK disk image format, used for +3DOS and other systems,
contains a lot of metadata to describe the
format of the disk, the tracks and the sectors...

In +3DOS, sector 0 of track 0 cannot be used for Forth blocks,
because it must contain the disk specification, even for sector-level
access.  Since the size of a sector is 512 B, only one Forth block is
lost because of this restriction.

endif::plus3dos[]

ifdef::gplusdos[]

// The MGT disk image format {{{2
=== The MGT disk image format

The MGT disk images (used for G+DOS and other systems) do not
include format-describing metadata: The MGT file is just a dump of the original
800-KiB disk. Beside, G+DOS does not need its own metadata (the directory
tracks) be present in order to read or write sectors, making the whole disk
usable for Forth blocks.

In fact the Solo Forth's MGT disk images that contain Forth blocks are
identical to Forth block files. Therefore they can be browsed or edited using a
Forth block editor.

endif::gplusdos[]

ifdef::trdos[]

// The TRD disk image format {{{2
=== The TRD disk image format

The TRD disk images, one of the formats used for TR-DOS disks,
are dumps of the original disks, without any format-describing
metadata. But TR-DOS needs the system track (track
0) to contain certain data in order to recognize the disk, even for
sector-level access. That's why only 636 KiB can be used for Forth
blocks, 4 KiB (one track) less than the maximum capacity.

Anyway, TRD disk images can be browsed with a Forth block editor, with
the following restriction: blocks 0..3 will be shown as garbage (they
are track 0 of the disk), while the actual first Forth block of the
disk (block 0) will be shown as block 4.

// How to make a library index {{{2
=== How to make a library index

The `need` word and its related words search the index line (line 0)
of all blocks of the disk for the first occurence of the required
word, within a configurable range of blocks (using the variables
`first-locatable` and `last-locatable`).  Of course, nested `need` are
resolved the same way: searching the library from the beginning.  This
can be slow.  This is not a problem, because the goal of Solo Forth is
<<_write_programs,cross development>>,
and therefore only the last step of the development
loop, i.e., the compilation of the sources from the disk images
created in the host system, compilation that includes all the slow
searching of library blocks, is done in the real (actually, emulated)
machine. But the system includes a tool to create an index of the
library, which is used to locate their contents instantaneously, what
makes things more comfortable when the Forth system is used
interactively.

How to use the library index:

1. Load the indexer with ``need make-thru-index``.
2. Make the index and activate it with `make-thru-index`.
3. The default behaviour (no index) can be restored with
   `use-no-index`.  The index can be reactivated with
   `use-thru-index`.

The indexer creates an index (actually, a Forth word list whose
definitions use no code or data space) and changes the default
behaviour of `need` and related words to use it. Then ``need name``
will automatically start loading the first block where “name”
is defined

NOTE: The name space is in far memory, a virtual 64-KiB space formed
by 4 configurable memory banks (see `far-banks`). No code or data
space is used by the indexer.

An alternative indexer is under development in the library file
<blocks.indexer.fly.fs>. It will not make and index in advance:
Instead, it will index the blocks on the fly, when they are searched
the first time.

ifdef::trdos[]

The programs included in disk 2, and the tests and benchmarks included in disk
3, need words from the library, which is in disks 1a and 1b.  Therefore, three
disk drives must be configured as block drives, using `3-block-drives`.

Let's see an example, how to load the game called Tetris for
Terminals, which is in disk 2.

. <<_run,Run Solo Forth>>.
. Insert the first library disk image (disk 1a) into the first drive.
. Insert the second library disk image (disk 1b) into the second drive.
. Insert the programs disk image (disk 2) into the third drive.
. Execute command ``1 load`` in order to `load` the `need` utility from
  the first library disk.
. Execute the command `need 3-block-drives`, which loads
  `3-block-drives` from the library disk and then executes it, setting the
  first three drives as block drives in their normal order.
. Execute the command ``need tt``, which locates the first block of
  the game (in disk 2) and loads it, loading its requirements from the
  library as needed.
. Follow the instructions.

When `3-block-drives` is executed, the blocks of the first three disk
drives are seen as one single set, i.e. ``200 list`` will list block
200 from the first disk, but ``850 list`` will list the block from the
second disk:

The programs included in disk 2, and the tests and benchmarks included in disk

must be configured first as block drives, using `2-block-drives`.

Let's see an example, how to load the game called Tetris for
Terminals, which is in disk 2.

. <<_run,Run Solo Forth>>.
. Insert the library disk image (disk 1) into the first drive.
. Insert the programs disk image (disk 2) into the second drive.
. Execute command ``1 load`` in order to `load` the `need` utility from

  first and the second drives as block drives.
. Execute the command ``need tt``, which locates the first block of
  the game (in disk 2) and loads it, loading its requirements from the
  library (disk 1) as needed.
. Follow the instructions.

When `2-block-drives` is executed, the blocks of the first two disk
drives are seen as one single set, i.e. ``200 list`` will list block
200 from the first disk, but ``850 list`` will list the block from the

// How to write Forth programs {{{1
[#_write_programs]
== How to write Forth programs

There are two ways to write source code:

. In the Forth system itself, using a classic Forth block editor (two
  of them are included in the library: `gforth-editor` and
  `specforth-editor`).
. In a modern operating system, using an ordinary text editor and then
  converting the sources into a ZX Spectrum disk image, ready to be
  used as a block disk by the Forth system. This is the recommended
  method. We call it “cross development”, though the actual
  compilation of the Forth sources is done in the ZX Spectrum.

Briefly, the steps of cross development are the following:

. Edit the sources of the Forth program on the host operating system, using the
  simple FSB format described in the documentation of
  http://programandala.net/en.program.fsb.html[fsb] and
  http://programandala.net/en.program.fsb2.html[fsb2].
. Convert the sources into Forth block disk images using
  http://programandala.net/en.program.fsb2.html[fsb2].
. <<_run,Run Solo Forth>> on a ZX Spectrum emulator and compile the Forth
  program from the disk image. Further testing and debugging can be done in the
  Forth system.

In order to use Solo Forth to write programs for ZX Spectrum,
programmers already acquainted with Forth and GNU/Linux systems can
extract all the required information from the <Makefile> of Solo
Forth.

The only difference between <<_rebuild,building Solo Forth>> and
building a Forth program is the content of disk 0 (the boot disk),
if needed, and the library modules included in the library disk,
which usually also contains the source of the program at the end.  If the program
doesn't need to use the disk at run-time, you can simply copy the
default disk 0, and boot it to `load` your program from block 1 of your
customized disk 1, with a simple ``1 load``. When the loading
finishes, you can save a system snapshot, in SZX format, using the
corresponding option of your ZX Spectrum emulator.

Some games are provided as examples, in <<_disks,disk 2>>.  In order
to try, improve and fix the Forth system during its development, two
more complex game projects are being developed at the same time:

- http://programandala.net/en.program.black_flag.html[Black Flag]
  (http://github.com/programandala-net/black-flag[Black Flag in
  GitHub]).
- http://programandala.net/en.program.nuclear_waste_invaders.html[Nuclear
  Waste Invaders]
  (http://github.com/programandala-net/nuclear-waste-invaders[Nuclear
  Waste Invaders in GitHub]).

They are not finished yet, but they can be useful as examples of
program development with Solo Forth. See how the useful `load-program`
is used in block 1 of their sources.

== How to rebuild Solo Forth

If you modify the sources, you have to build new disk images for your
DOS of choice. Also the manual depends on the documentation included
in the sources.

First, see the requirements listed in the header of the <Makefile>
file and install the required programs. Then enter the project
directory and use one of the following commands to build the disk
images or the manual for your DOS of choice:

// Exception codes {{{1
== Exception codes

Exception codes (also called `throw` codes of `throw` values) are used
as prescribed by the Forth-2012 standard: codes -255..-1 are used only
as assigned by the standard, and codes -4095..-256 are reserved for
Solo Forth.  Therefore, programs shall not define values for use with
`throw` in the range -4095..-1.

[%autowidth]
.Exception code ranges

| Range         | Reserved for

| 1..32767      | Programs

| -1127..-1000  | Solo Forth: {dosname}
| -1154..-1128  | Solo Forth: ZX Spectrum OS (BASIC)
| -4095..-1155  | Solo Forth
| -32768..-4096 | Programs
|===

The original ZX Spectrum OS error codes are included (in range -1154..-1128)
because a few of them may be returned by some DOS words in special cases.

The way errors are displayed is configurable.  By default only the exception
code is displayed by an uncatched `throw`, because the default action of
`.throw`, which is a deferred word, is `.throw#`.  In order to display also the
error description, the alternative action `.throw-message` must be loaded from
the <<_library,library>> with ``need .throw-message``.
