// Version 0.13.0  {{{1
== Version 0.13.0

Released on 2017-02-07.

Another version that includes more new features, bug fixes,
improvements and changes than planned, having being heavily tested
during the development of two game projects.

Some things are worth to be commented apart:

- Only one assembler. The transition from the old assembler to the new
  one has been completed.
- Full rewrite of the color management: the temporary attribute of the
  OS is manipulated directly. This method is much faster and more
  compact.  Alternative words are provided to use the BASIC-like
  method (i.e., control characters).
- Deep modification of the UDG management to use only the character
  range 0..255. Now the first UDG character is always character 0, in
  any context (so far, it could be 0 or 128, depending on the word
  used).  Now the UDG code range of `emit` is coherent, and its
  default behaviour can be configured (by choosing the first character
  it will consider a UDG, instead of printing it through the ROM
  routine) Eventually this will be improved further in order to
  support 8-bit character sets.
- Improved support to store data in far memory.
- Finally, `circle` is included, and a very fast one.
- Improved support to use `bleep`, and also to convert parameters of
  BASIC's `BEEP`.
- New standard tools to manipulate strings: `replaces`, `substitute`
  and `unescape`.
- On TR-DOS, the library can be used on any disk. This makes the
  system actually usable on this DOS, and makes it possible to improve
  its support.

=== New

- Add `link>wid`.
- Add `>true`, `2>true`, `>false`, `2>false`.
- Add `(cursor-addr)` and `cursor-addr`.
- Add alternative `cursor-addr` and `(cursor-addr)`.
- Add basic words to store and compile strings in far memory: `far,`,
  `fars,`, `farsconstant`, `farsconstants,`, `far,"`, `/farsconstants`
  and `farsconstants-does>`.
- Add variants of the far-memory string arrays that return the strings
  in the circular string buffer: `save-farstring`, `far>sconstants`,
  `/far>sconstants`.
- Add `dot-quote-bench`, to compare printing one single char with
  `emit` or `."`.
- Add `-1..1`.
- Add `view`.
- Add `?seconds`.
- Add `faravariable`, `far2avariable`, `farcavariable`.
- Add `name>str`, a factor of `name>string`.
- Add `name>name`, an alternative `>name` and `>name-bench`.  The
  current Z80 version of `>name` is not needed in the kernel.  An
  alternative version in Forth is being tested.
- Add `#words`.
- Add `/counted-string` constant.
- Add `replaces`.
- Add `substitute` and `unescape`.
- Add `xt-replaces`.
- Add `1/string`.  A faster alternative for the low-level idiom `1
  /string`. Beside, it saves six bytes in the kernel.
- Add `g+dos`, `tr-dos` and `+3dos`.
- Add `beep`, `dhz>bleep`, `middle-octave`, `/octave`,
  `octave-changer`, `beep>dhz`, `beep`, and a new `beep>bleep`.  The
  support of Sinclar BASIC's `BEEP` is complete.  The conversion of
  parameters from `beep` to `bleep` is fully factored and reusable.
- Add `?shift`.
- Add `u.s`.
- Add `inverse-on` and `inverse-off`.
- Add `overprint-on` and `overprint-off`.
- Add `.words`.
- Add `mask+attr!` and `mask+attr@`.
- Add `circle`.
- Add `noop-routine`.  A useful counterpart of `noop`, needed by the
  new implementation of a configurable `circle`.
- Add `blackout`.
- Add `attr-cls`.  A useful factor of `cls`
- Add `]cl` and `]1l`.
- Add `contrast`.
- Add `attr>ink`.
- Add `default-bank-routine` and `e-bank-routine`.
- Add `lower-routine`.
- Add constants for attribute masks: `bright-mask`, `unbright-mask`,
  `flash-mask`, `unflash-mask`, `ink-mask`, `unink-mask`,
  `paper-mask`, `unpaper-mask`.
- Add words to manipulate the graphic coordinates: `g-xy`, `g-x`,
  `g-y`, `g-at-xy`, `g-at-x`, `g-at-y`, `g-home`.
- Add `far>sconstant` and `farsconstants>`.
- Add `os-sp`.
- Add `g-type`, `g-emit`, `g-cr`, etc. (They were almost finished but
  not tested).
- Add `mode32-max-char`.
- Add TR-DOS `set-drive` and related code.  Finally, the library can
  be used on any TR-DOS disk drive.

=== Fixes

- Fix storage of unresolved assembler references.
- Fix `runtil`, `auntil` and `ragain`.
- Fix sound effects `laser-gun`, `ambulance` and `white-noise`.
- Fix `scroll-1px-up`.
- Fix `wordlists`.
- Fix erasing of `esc-context`.
- Fix loading of `see`.
- Fix `find-name-from`.  A very subtle bug, first detected on
  2016-12-06: When `hp` crossed the 16-KiB boundary, sometimes a
  previous word was not found. Finally, the error condition has been
  found out: a previous word of the same length than the latest one is
  not found after crossing the 16-KiB boundary...  The reason was the
  difference between the actual _nt_ and its converted version in
  paged memory, which was used for restoring.
- Fix `fartype`.
- Make `s\"` and `.\"` use standard escapes by default.
- Add `default-font` for `cold`.  `cold` didn't set the default font.
  That was a subtle bug. In order to reuse code, `set-font` has been
  moved from the library to the kernel, but it has been rewritten is
  Z80 to save some bytes.
- Fix and improve `ocr`.
- Fix `last-column` and `last-row`.
- Fix needing of `??`.
- Fix needing of `16hex.`.
- Fix `error>ordinal`, which was not updated.
- Fix and update `fyi`.
- Fix `fzx-emit`.
- Rename `beep>bleep` to `hz>bleep`.  The word does not convert the
  parameters of BASIC's `beep`, but hertzs.
- Fix requirement of `printable-ascii-char?`.
- Fix and improve `where` and `list-lines`.
- Fix requirements of `xdrop`.
- Fix `parse-esc-string`.
- Fix `(pixel-scroll-up`.
- Fix needing of G+DOS `set-drive`.
- Fix loading of the Pong game.

=== Improvements

- Write `attr`, `attr-addr`, and `(attr-addr)` in Z80 opcodes.  No
  need to use the assembler for these small words.
- Remove the old assembler (`z80-asm`). Update the new one
  (`z80-asm,`), move the `assembler` vocabulary to the library, in
  order to use `need assembler` to load the new assembler when needed.
  Convert all words to the new assembler.
- Rewrite `ndrop` and `2ndrop` with Z80 opcodes.
- Improve words to page in and page out the Plus D: `plusd-in`,
  `plusd-out`, `plusd-in,`, `plusd-out,`.
- Improve `default-bank`.
- Improve loading of `see-xt` and `see-body-from`.
- Improve `find-name-from`: 3 bytes less, 5% faster.
- Improve `create` (2 bytes less).
- Improve the word-lists interface.  More coherent and less cryptic
  names and functions: Remove `link>wid`; remove `wid>name`; rename
  `(wid>name` to `wordlist>name`; rename `wid>link` to
  `wordlist>link`; rename `.wid` to `.wordlist`; rename
  `wid>vocabulary` to `wordlist>vocabulary`.  add `wordlist-name@` and
  `wordlist-name!`; rename `wid-of` to `wordlist-of`; rename
  `named-wid` to `latest>wordlist`
- Improve `papery`, `brighty`, `flashy`.
- Improve `permcolor`.
- Rename `pause` to `?frames`, and `do-pause` to `frames`.  The name
  "pause" was taken from BASIC but the new names are clearer, and
  consistent with `ms` and `seconds`. Add a new `pause` after Sinclair
  BASIC.  Just a convenience to adapt BASIC programs.
- Improve `see`: type strings between quotes.  This is clearer when
  they have leading or trailing spaces.
- Improve needing of `columns` and `rows`.
- Improve `2avariable`.
- Improve `?repeat`.
- Improve needing of words to print numbers in radix.
- Improve needing of control flow stack words.
- Change the behaviour of `window` and `set-window`.  Now they are
  more versatile.
- Document how data in headers space affect `>name`.
- Replace `xdepth.` with `.depth`;rename `.x` to `.xs`.
- Rewrite `color!` and `color-mask!` in Z80.
- Rewrite `set-udg`,`get-udg` and `get-font` in Z80.
- Improve needing of 128K sound words.
- Restore default behaviour of `.s`.  `.s` was provisionaly modified
  some time ago to print unsigned numbers.  Now `u.s` does the job.
  Both words are in the kernel only during the development.
- Improve needing symmetric/floored-division operators.
- Rename words that store/fetch sys color attributes.  Rename "color"
  prefix to "attr", "permcolor" prefix to "perm-attr".
- Rewrite `perm-attr!` and `perm-attr-mask!` in Z80.
- Rewrite `attr@` and `attr-mask@` in Z80.
- Rewrite `perm-attr@` and `perm-attr-mask@` in Z80.
- Make all attribute words accessible to `need`.
- Improve the implementation of `xstack`.  Rename `set-xstack` to
  `xstack`.  Make `allot-xstack` and `allocate-xstack` more versatile:
  they don't parse a name anymore, but simply return the address of
  the new stack.  Remove `xp@`, `xp!` and `xp+!`.  Fix `xfree`.
  Improve and complete documentation of all words.  Make all words
  individually accessible to `need`.
- Rewrite `odd?` and `even?` in Z80.
- Rename `paper!`/`paper@` and family to "set-/get-".  The new names
  are more logical, because the values are not stored or fetched
  verbatim, but as bits of the temporary attribute. Beside, the new
  naming convention can be generalized and used also with the printing
  modes (`inverse` and `overprint`).  Rewrite `set-paper` and
  `set-ink` in Z80.
- Rename/modify `paper` and family to `paper.`, etc.  These names make
  clear what these words do. Beside, they don't change the permanent
  attribute any more.  Move `paper.`, `ink.`, `bright.` and `flash.`
  to the library.  Improve `bright.` and `flash.` to accept a flag (so
  far they checked only bit 0 of the parameter; nowe any non-zero
  value turns them on, what is the usual behaviour in Forth) and color
  8 (transparent).
- Make `cls` use the temporary attribute.  This behaviour is more
  logical and practical because the permanent attribute is not
  modified by other words any more.
- Add decimal prefix to system variables addresses. This avoids
  problems.
- Improve needing of color constants.
- Rename the far-memory routines constants.  A clearer convention
  is used for constants that return addresses of kernel routines.
- Update needing of `binary`.
- Rename and improve the scroll and pan words.
- Rewrite `spaces` in Z80.
- Rename the variants of `type` that print on fields.  Rename
  `type-left`, `type-right` and `type-center` to `type-left-field`,
  `type-right-field` and `type-center-field`, because they erase the
  field with padding spaces, and there will be a parallel set of words
  that don't.  Improve `type-center-field` and `type-right-field`.
- Improve `mode32-emit` to be configurable.
- Rewrite `bounds` in Z80.
- Convert all UDG words to the 0-index-only convention.  All "0udg"
  words have been renamed after their "udg" counterparts, which have
  been removed.  Other words have become useless too and have been
  removed.
- Improve `udg>`, `ocr-chars` and `ocr-first`.  Now `ocr-chars` and
  `ocr-first` are character variables. No need for a whole cell in
  this case.
- Unify DOS symbols, notation and layout.  Especially TR-DOS and +3DOS
  have some analogous routines, that have been named and arranged the
  same way.

=== Other changes

- Rename `test-pixel` to `get-pixel`; also in mode 176.
- Remove the old "system bank" code. The far-memory system made it
  unnecessary.
- Convert `voc-link` to `latest-wordlist`.  Now the _wid_ is used as
  pointer to the previous word list.  This method is simpler and
  clearer, and `latest-wordlist` is a better name than the old
  fig-Forth `voc-link`, which anyway relates to vocabularies.
- Rename `udg-chars` to `default-udg-chars`.
- Move far-memory string words to their own module.
- Remove string arrays that don't leave a count.  There were two
  variants of each string array. It's simpler to keep only the variant
  that returns the count of compiled strings, which is useful most of
  the times.
- Benchmark and remove alternative `m*`.
- Remove the kernel copy of `where`.
- Remove `exit` after conditional intepretation.  The objective of
  `exit` at the end of conditional comments (`?\` and `?(`) was to
  interpret blocks faster, leaving the current block after the needed
  code had been interpreted.  But the space in the block is more
  important.
- Remove slower versions of `rshift` and `lshift`.  They are only 3
  bytes smaller, but much slower (1.33 and 1.69 the execution time of
  the faster default versions).
- Move remaining tests to the tests module.
- Remove `permcolor` and `2permcolor` definers.  Hardly useful.
- Rename `color` definer to `attr-setter`, and `2color` to
  `mask+attr-setter`.
- Remove `paper>attr`.  No need for this word. `papery` can be used
  instead.
- Move `span` to the library.
- Move `!bank`, `c!bank`, `@bank` and `c@bank` to the library.
- Move `upper`, `uppers`, `faruppers` and `lowers` to the library.
- Modify `digit?` to use the `lower` routine.
- Remove old unused implementations of `um*`.
- Move `permanent-colors` to the library and rename it to
  `mask+attr>perm`.  This word is not needed in the kernel any more.
  The new name is consistent with the words that manipulate the
  current attribute.
- Remove `0udg-at-xy-echo`, `at-xy-echo-0udg`.  No need for them in
  the kernel.  They are already in the library, with different names,
  since 2017-01-09. They are still experimental.
- Move `read-block` and `write-block` to the main file of the kernel,
  because they are identical in G+DOS, TR-DOS and +3DOS.
- Move TR-DOS `get-drive` and `cat` to the library.
- Move `rec/track` to the kernel.
- Remove `lib-order` and family.  These words were never used, because
  the method was not low-level enough: `need` had to be modified to
  use it explicitily.  A better, transparent method to use several
  configurable library disks at the same time will be introduced in
  v0.14.0.
- Rename the "modules" directories to "addons".  The name was
  confusing because these directories contain code not integrated in
  the library yet, while in all the documentation the name "module"
  means a library file.

- Add assembler labels.
- Add `switch`, `>cell-string`.
- Add `c>bstring`, `2>bstring`.
- Add `hide-internal`, to complete the old `internal` module.
- Add VFX-like `module`.  An implementation of VFX's `module` by
  Ulrich Hoffmann in Forth-94.
- Add SwiftForth's `package`.
- Add `c!exchange`, new `exchange`, `cexchange`.
- Add `sconstants`, `/sconstants`.
- Add `u>str`.
- Add `uppers1`.
- Add `make-block-characters`.
- Add `block-characters` and `0udg>`.
- Add `odd?`.
- Add `set-font`, `get-font`, `set-udg`, `get-udg`, `rom-font`.
- Add `even?`.
- Add `case-sensitive`, `lower`, `lowers`, `farlowers`.
- Add `udg-chars` to define the default UDG 'A'..'U'.
- Add case-sensitive escaped strings.  This improvement makes the
  escaped strings Forth-2012 compliant, and compatible with the ZX
  Spectrum escaped UDG notation (uppercase '\A'..'\U').
- Implement escaped strings search order.  This method is analogous to
  the main search order, and lets the application configure the chars
  escaped by `s\"`, `.\"` and other words.
- Add `window`, a basic implementation of text windows.
- Add constants for common control keys.
- Add `plot176`.
- Start the new `rdraw` (not finished yet).
- Add more words to plot and draw in 255x176 mode.  The graphic
  commands of Sinclair BASIC work in 255x176 instead of 255x191.
  Therefore words that use the same resolution and origin are useful
  to adapt BASIC programs.  New words: `(pixel-addr176)`,
  `pixel-addr176`, `set-pixel176`, `reset-pixel176`,
  `toggle-pixel176`, `test-pixel176`, `set-save-pixel176`,
  `aline176`.
- Add `fyi`.
- Add `ifelse` operator.

=== Fixes

- Fix `:noname` with the new `call,`.
- Fix needing `d<>`, `trim`, `char`, `[char]`, `word`.
- Fix `+place`.
- Adapt `module` to far memory.
- Make `name<name` compatible with far memory.
- Fix `search`: empty substring caused crash.
- Fix compilation of `s\"`, `.\"`: keep search order.
- Fix `bright!`.
- Load `see` (old `decode`) preserving the word lists config.
- Fix conditional definition of `/kk`.
- Fix `privatize`.
- Fix `u.r`.
- Fix `/hold` and `floored` environmental query strings.
- Fix grep expression in `fs2fba.sh`.
- Fix and improve several issues in both assemblers.  Main changes, in
  the `z80-asm,` assembler: Fix `jp>jr` to manage also unconditional
  jumps; fix `relse`, `rwhile` and `runtil`.
- Fix `jp>jr`.
- Fix names of `im1,` and `im2,`.
- Make `inverse-cond` and `jp>jr` `z80-asm`-safe.  There were problems
  when `z80-asm` was loaded before `z80-asm,`, because `z80-asm` has
  words homonymous with Forth words.
- Fix: Make `cold` reset the behaviour of `warn`.
- Fix code typo in `fast-(pixel-addr)`.
- Fix `rstep`.

=== Improvements

- Documentation of many words has been improved. All documentation is
  still in the sources, though.
- The needing of many words has been improved, i.e., now they can be
  accessed individually by `need`.
- Rename `transient[ ]transient -transient` to `transient
  end-transient forget-transient` and improve them.
- Update the Vim syntax file.
- Add Vim ftdetect file.
- Make `link@` an alias, for speed.
- Make `words` and family configurable.  Sometimes it's useful to see
  more information in a listing of words.  Now `words`,
  `wordlist-words` and `words-like` can be configured with a deferred
  word.
- Add a configurable resume key to `~~control`.
- Rewrite `lengths` in Z80.
- Improve and test `[switch`.
- Improve `does>` with `call,`.
- Use `cell+ cell+` and `cell- cell-`.  They are a little bit faster
  than `[ 2 cells ] literal +` and `[ 2 cells ] literal -` and save
  one cell.
- Improve `(located)` to detect empty strings.  Actually this was a
  bug: an empty string from `need` and family was accepted and looked
  for, and of course it matched the header of the first locatable
    block of the library.
- Improve G+DOS `transfer-block` with `literal`.
- Rewrite `d-` with Z80 opcodes, to make it independent from the
  assembler.
- Improve kernel's first-boot routine.
- Improve `+field`: Make it a deferred word and add 3 implementations:
  `+field-unopt`, `+field-opt-0` and `+field-opt-0124`.
- Make `negate` 6 T faster and 2 B smaller.
- Improve `~~control` to accept also any resume key.
- Rename `paper>` to `attr>paper`.  Rename `>paper` to `paper>attr`.
  Rewrite them in Z80.
- Increase return stack.
- Define default `/kk`.
- Improve `switch:` with character and 2-cell clauses.
- Improve `export` with `alias`.
- Rewrite `ms`.
- Rewrite `8*` in Z80.
- Make escaped chars configurable in `s\"` and `.\"`. Support escaped
  graphic chars (BASin notation).
- Save one byte in `find-name-from`.
- Improve `~~` with clearer output.
- Improve `du<`.
- Improve `.depth`: 4 bytes smaller.

=== Other changes

- Store definition names in lowercase.  This makes more sense, because
  this way words can be typed and interpreted in lowercase, which is
  the default in the sources, also when the new case-sensitive mode is
  activated.
- Use `?(` instead of `[if]` in the library.  Compilation of standard
  `[if]` needs more data space and is slower than the conditional
  comment `?(`, which is enough for all the conditional compilation
  needs of the library.
- Split the `indexer` module.  Part of the code can be shared with an
  alternative indexer under development.
- Show version-specific background image at startup.
- Improve the `user` module. Add conditional compilation.
- Reorganize <make/> and <tools/>.  Now <make/> contains the programs
  used by <Makefile>, and <tools/> will contain tools for the Forth
  programmer.
- Move `.line` to its proper module.
- Move code and list tools common to both editors to an independent
  module.
- Rename Wong's `array` to `avalue` and extend it.
- Rename `c!set-bits`, `c!reset-bits`, `c!toggle-bits` to `cset`,
  `creset`, `ctoggle`.
- Rename `c@test-bits` and `c@test-bits?` to `c@and` and `c@and?`.
- Rename `decode` to `see`.  The tool is not complete yet, but it fits
  the description of the standard word `see`, therefore there's no
  need to keep its original name.
- Rename `-branch` to `+branch`. The name was not consistent with
  `?branch` and `0branch`.
- Move `u.r` to the library.
- Prepare the implementation of `use-fly-index`, an alternative
  indexer.
- Move `storer`, `cstorer`, `2storer` to a module.
- Remove old `get-order` and `order@` from library.
- Move `seal` to the library.
- Move `catch` to the library.
- Combine small control structures into one module.
- Combine small definers into one module.
- Move `fartype` and `fartype-ascii` to the library.
- Move `?leave` to the library.
- Move `warnings` and family to the library.
- Move `search-wordlist` to the library.
- Remove `blocks`, a duplicate of `blk/disk`.
- Move `doer-test` to the tests module.
- Remove old unused `bank-boundary?`.
- Replace `scr` with `lastblk` in `load` and `reload`.
- Rename `~~show` to `~~info`.
- Remove mutual needing of `n>r`, `nr>`.
- Rename `?jr-range` and `?page` to `?rel`.  The word is common to
  both assemblers but had different names.
- Rename module of `switch:`, after the usual convention.
- Rename `>cell-string` to `>bstring`, which is completed with the new
  words `c>bstring` and `2>bstring`.
- Rename the `internal` module words to extend it: Old: `internal`,
  `external`, `module` New: `internal`, `end-internal`,
  `unlink-internal`
- Rename "common" and "misc" module filenames.  The change makes those
  modules more visible; besides, by default they are listed before
  their related modules.
- Rename `exchange` to `!exchange`.
- Rename the `environment?` module after the usual convention.
- Remove `(wait)` from the kernel.
- Rename `jpnext`, `jppushhl`: `jpnext,`, `jppushhl,`.  The new names
  are consistent with the rest of similar words also defined in the
  kernel: `jp,` and `call,`. Beside, `z80-asm,`, which uses the comma
  suffix convention,  will be the only assembler in a future version.
- Rename `rdraw`, `adraw` to `rdraw176`, `adraw176`.  These
  implementations use only 176 pixel rows of the screen, like Sinclair
  BASIC. They can be useful for conversions from BASIC.
- Convert `rdraw176` to the `z80-asm,` assembler.
- Convert `inkey`, `get-inkey` to the `z80-asm,` assembler.
- Move kernel aliases after the words they point to.  This change
  makes the output of `see` clearer in certain cases,  because `>name`
  searches the dictionary from oldest to newest definition.  Anyway,
  this is the order aliases are defined outside the kernel.
- Rename `from` to `need-from`.  This word is seldom needed.  `from`
  is a generic, more useful name in application context.
- Change the assembler of pixel graphic words.  Convert all of them
  from the deprecated `z80-asm` to `z80-asm,`.
- Rename `wait-for-key` to `discard-key`.
- Move `s'` from its own module to the misc strings module.
- Improve the description of the Forth tools used by GNU make to build
  the Forth system.
- Compact the library to fit the 636 KiB available in a TR-DOS disk
  image.

=== Background image

From version 0.12.0, Solo Forth shows a version-specific background
image the first time it boots. The image of this version is the
following:

- Title: Alonso Quixano reading books of chavalry.
- Author: Gustave Doré (1832-1883).
- Book: _El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de La Mancha_ (_The
  Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha_) (1605), chapter 1, by
  Miguel de Cervantes (1547-1616).

The ZX Spectrum image was converted from the
http://www.h-net.org/~cervantes/doreesp2.htm[pictures scanned by
Claudio Paganelli] from the italian edition _Don Chisciotte della
Mancia_, published by Edoardo Perino (Rome, 1888).

// Version 0.11.0  {{{1
== Version 0.11.0

Released on 2016-11-16.

The goal of this version was to implement a virtual 64-KiB continuous
space built from 4 configurable memory banks, in order to increase the
headers space of the Forth system (so far only one single 16-KiB bank
was used for that), and also to provide the programmer an easy method
to use all the paged memory.  It has been called "far memory".

=== New

- Far memory: A virtual 64-KiB continuous space, built from 4
  configurable memory banks. It's used by the Forth system to store
  the dictionary headers, and can be used transparently by the
  programmer.
- Basic support for the far-memory system in the kernel: `far-banks`,
  `far`, `?next-bank`, `?previous-bank`, `far@`, `far!`, `farc@`,
  `farc!`, `farplace`, `fartype`, `faruppers`.
- Optional library words to manage the far memory: `far2@`, `far2!`,
  `far@+`, `farc@+`, `far2@+`, `far+!`, `farc+!`, `move>far`,
  `move<far`, `cmove>far`, `cmove<far`, `fartype-ascii`, `fardump`,
  `farwdump`, `farallot`.
- Add `u>ud`.
- Add `word-length-mask`.
- Try and document `indexer`. It did not work in previous versions
  because the old 16-KiB bank used to store the definition headers was
  not large enough: the index occupied 12 KiB, while the kernel
  definitions occupied 5 KiB. After implementing the 64-KiB far
  memory, the indexer works fine.  Its usage has been documented in
  the source and the README.

=== Fixes

- Fix description of the header structure.
- Fix requiring `gcd`, `%` and `u%`.
- Fix `\`, which used `span` instead of `#tib`.  This bug has been
  invisible for a long time, because `\` is not used in the command
  line.
- Fix block title of the calculator module: it caused `>=` and other
  calculator operators be found by `need` instead of the integer ones,
  because the calculator module is before the integer operators in the
  library disk.  This problem affected the "tt" sample game, which
  also lacked `need randomize`.
- Fix conditional compilation of `alias!`.
- Fix requiring `<=>'.

=== Improvements

- Update Vim syntax file.
- Rewrite `c!bank`, `!bank`, `@bank` and `c@bank` in Z80.
- Simplify `home`.  No need for specific versions of `home` for the
  screen modes. Only `at-xy` has to be reconfigured by the screen
  modes, if needed.
- Improve the address register module.  The code still used direct
  jumps to `pushhl` instead of `jppushhl`, which is faster with no
  size penalty.
- Improve documentation of the `assert(` tools.
- Document the `~~` debugging tool.
- Compact the assemblers, saving one block each.
- Make all buffers contiguous.  Now the circular string buffer can be
  configured to use the disk buffer and the terminal input buffer as
  extra space.
- Improve documentation of `dump` and `wdump`.
- Improve the default `case` with `alias`.

=== Other changes

- Remove the old unused code of the old search order.
- Make Z80 registers and flags uppercase in kernel's comments.
- Rename "names pointer" to "headers pointer".  The whole header of
  the definition is stored at the pointed address, not just its name.
  Therefore the old `np`, `np!` and `np@` have been renamed to `hp`,
  `hp!` and `hp@`.
- Rename `code-field,` to `call,` in `assembler`.  The old
  `code-field,`, needed in the kernel, does exactly the same as
  `call,` in the `z80-asm,` assembler. So it has been renamed, moved
  to the `assembler` word list and removed from the assembler.
- Move `8*` from the assemblers to the operators.
 
// Version 0.10.0  {{{1
== Version 0.10.0

Released on 2016-10-23.

Besides many new features, fixes, improvements and changes, this
version includes disk images not only for G+DOS but also for TR-DOS
and +3DOS.  The support for TR-DOS and +3DOS is not finished: The
TR-DOS version can access the library only from drive A, and it has no
words to manage disk files; the +3DOS version can not use the library.

=== New

- Add `-1`.  `-1` is defined with the former code of `true`, and
  `true` is converted to an alias.  This saves 8 bytes in the kernel
  and makes any compiled -1 faster than a literal and one cell
  smaller.
- Add `''` and `>>name`.  These words allow to get the execution token
  pointer of a name, and convert it to its associated name token; this
  makes it possible to get the actual name of an alias, what is
  impossible from its shared execution token.
- Add `['']`.
- Add `gcd` operator.
- Add color constants and color modifiers.
- Add a 128K sound editor.  First version. It's usable but needs
  improvements.
- Support for TR-DOS (not finished: the library can be accesed only
  from drive A).
- Add `blks` checker.
- Add `lib-order`.  So far the library must be one single disk.
  `lib-order`, `set-lib-order` and `get-lib-order` will make it
  possible to use several library disks and configure the order in
  which they are searched, up to the maximum allowed by the DOS. These
  words are not used by `need` yet, so they are useless at the moment.
- Build disks for +3DOS (the library can not be accesed yet).
- Add `ref-xdpb` to the +3DOS version.
- Add `first-udg` and `udg-row[`.
- Add `exec-bench`.  This bench compares the execution time of
  executing two pieces of code depending on a flag, using three
  methods.
- Add `fetch-bench`.
- Add `set-pixel-bench`.
- Add `pixels-bench`.
- Add `bitmap>attr-addr` and `pixel-attr-addr`.
- Add `store-bench`.
- Add `allot-xstack`.
- Add `rec/track`.

=== Fixes

- Fix `>body` and `body>`.  Their codes were exchanged when they were
  moved to the library.
- Fix `decode`, which showed the usage instructions before checking
  the word.
- Fix `need-here`.
- Fix `find-name` with `?do`.
- Fix needing `c@+`.
- Fix requiring `c1+!`, `c1-!`, `1+!` and `1-!`.
- Fix G+DOS `(cat)`; update the G+DOS module.
- Fix conditional compilation of some library words.  The conditional
  compilation of `]l`, `]2l`, `exec` ,`eval`, `save-here` and
  `restore-here` was wrong.
- Fix requisite of "Siderator 2".
- Fix `load-app` to be compatible with `refill`.

=== Improvements

- Modify the structure of vocabularies.  Now vocabularies don't keep
  the data of a word list in their body.  Instead, they create a
  wordlist and store only its address. This way, `vocabulary` can be
  moved to the library, even if there are three vocabularies in the
  kernel (`root`, `forth` and `assembler`). But the main advantage of
  this change is conversion can work in both directions: a word list
  identifier can be get from a vocabulary name, no matter if the
  vocabulary was created with `vocabulary` or out of an existent word
  list; and a vocabulary can be created from a word list, and its
  structure will be identical to those created by `vocabulary`.
- Improve format of error messages.  Now a backslash is printed after
  the error code, and only when text messages are active. This looks
  clearer and saves 2 bytes in the kernel.
- Improve the `decode` tool.  Improve the check in `colon-cfa?`.
  Compact `decode-special`.
- Improve compilation of 8-bit literals.  `literal` is replaced with
  the new word `1literal` in `interpret-table`.  This causes 8-bit
  literals will be compiled by `cliteral` instead of `literal`, what
  saves one byte of data space and is faster at run-time.  `cliteral`
  was moved from the library to the kernel, and `byte?` was added in
  order to do the check.  These changes add 31 bytes to the kernel,
  but they will make the programs smaller and faster.
- Improve `0`, `1` and `2`.  These byte constants have been rewritten
  as code words. This makes them faster.
- Improve `constant` and `cconstant`.  Now they are faster: their
  run-time code runs directly into `@` and `c@`. This saves 8 bytes
  from the kernel.
- Improve `2constant`.  Now its run-time code (instead that of `2>r`,
  less used) runs directly into `2@`. This makes double constants a
  bit faster and saves one byte from the kernel.
- Improve needing of 128K sound effects.  Now every sound effect can
  be required individually.
- Improve definition of 128K sounds.  Now sounds are created with
  `sound` instead of `sound:`, and when they are executed they just
  play instead of returning the address of its data.
- Improve `sector-id` for G+DOS.
- Improve needing of `<is>`, `[is]` and `is`.  No `<is>` and `[is]`
  can be needed apart.
- Improve `pixels`.
- Improve documentation of `attr` and related words.

=== Other Changes

- Move `vocabulary` to library; adapt `assembler`.
- Use `wordlist` for `parse-escaped-string`.  No need to use
  `vocabulary` for a standard tool.
- Move `there` to the library.
- Reuse the code of `noop` to save 2 bytes.
- Reorganize the exception codes; add TR-DOS codes.  In order to make
  calculations easier, all DOS will share the range of exception
  codes.
- Start implementing ior to DOS calls.  The goal is all Forth words
  that call any DOS routine return an ior error result.
- Print DOS name in the greeting message.
- Organize the disk images in directories.
- Rename `error-messages-block` to `errors-block`.  Also combine
  blocks of its module to save two of them.
- Compact the library.  The code of several modules has been compacted
  and reorganized in order to save blocks, because of the 636 KiB
  usable in TR-DOS disk images.
- Split the tests and benchmarks into several disks, in order to make
  them fit 636-KiB TR-DOS disks.
- Rename disk images.  All disk image files have been renamed after a
  shorter and clearer format, easier to use with the SDL file
  interface of the Fuse emulator.  Now disks are numbered the same way
  in every DOS, with an ordinal number instead the identifier of the
  drive it's supposed to be used with.
- Make G+DOS' `transfer-sector` return an ior.
- Remove G+DOS' old `set-library-disk`.  `set-library-disk` and
  `get-library-disk` are superseded by `set-lib-order` and
  `get-lib-order`, which are implemented but not used by `locate` yet.
- Rename the disk files to fit any DOS.  The filename format 4+3 fits
  G+DOS (10 chars), +3DOS (8+3 chars) and TR-DOS (8 chars). This is
  simpler than creating different names for every DOS, and makes code
  compatible.
- Reuse code of `invert`.  Currently, the HL register needs to be
  inverted from assembler, in two DOS operations. There's no need to
  duplicate code. The fastest method is chosen, though the call makes
  `invert` a bit slower.
- Free RAM page 1 in +3DOS.  +3DOS uses RAM pages 1, 3, 4 and 6 as an
  array of 128 sector buffers (numbered 0...127), each of 512 bytes,
  thus 32 buffers per RAM page. The cache and RAM disk occupy two
  separate (contiguous) areas of this array.  In order to free RAM
  page 1 for Solo Forth, the default configuration must be modified,
  moving everything up and making the RAM disk 32 buffers smaller.
- Complete the +3DOS exception codes.
- Compact the source of `located`.
- Improve the output of `exec-bench`.
- Rename `xstack` to `allocate-xstack`.
- Make `(pixel-addr)` deferred.

// Version 0.9.0  {{{1
== Version 0.9.0

Released on 2016-05-18.

=== Main changes

- Finish `refill`, improve `-->`.  Now `refill` supports blocks. `-->`
  has been rewritten after it.
- Fix `[else]` with `refill`: Now `[if]` can cross block boundaries.
- Fix `to`, `2to` and `cto`.
- Add `load-app`.
- Fix `parse-all` (was `parse-line`); finish `execute-parsing`.
- Move `evaluate` and `string>source` to the library: These words are
  not used in the kernel, and `evaluate` can be rewritten after
  `execute-parsing`, which is in the library. This saves 28 bytes in
  the kernel.
- Add `!>`, `2!>` and `c!>`: Words that change the value of constants,
  inspired by IsForth's `!>`.
- Improve `value`, `to` and their variants: The default versions
  (standard `value` and `to`, and non-standard `2value`, `2to`,
  `cvalue` and `cto`) have been combined into one single module,
  rewritten as aliases and documented.  The standard alternative
  versions of `value`, `2value` and `to` have been documented.
- Rename non-parsing `value`/`to` to `val`/`toval`.

=== Other changes

- Fix harmless bug in `locate-reneed`.
- Improve compilation of "memory.misc.fsb": Remove dependency on the
  assembler. Add conditional compilation. Compact the blocks. Remove
  unused code.
- Rename `@cell+` to `@+`, add `2@+`.
- Fix `!a`, `!a+`, `c@a+`: The module of the address register has been
  compacted and documented.  During the process three bugs, caused by
  wrong Z80 opcodes, were discovered and fixed.
- Simplify the circular string buffer: So far the internal offset of
  the buffer was stored before the buffer data. It has been moved to
  `>csb`, which formerly was a fake variable, a constant that returned
  the address of the offset, and now is an actual variable. This saves
  a cell and is more versatile. In total, ten bytes are saved with
  some related changes.
- Add `2storer`.
- Remove `set-latest-lex`: A factor of `interpret` and `compile-only`
  that was not useful, because there are no more flags to set.
  Removing it saves 5 bytes.
- Improve `hided`.
- Fix requirements of `[cconst]`.
- Add benchmark for `?throw'.
- Document `fill`, `erase`, `blank`.
- Shorten `hex`: A branch saves one cell, more important than speed in
  this case.  `hex` and `decimal` have been documented.
- Rename `hided` to the correct `hidden`.
- Move `>body` and `body>` to the library.
- Improve `up`: Now `up` is a variable, not a constant that returns
  the address where the value is stored.  This change is necessary to
  implement multitasking, and it saves one cell.
- Improve conditional compilation of word lists tools.

// Version 0.8.0  {{{1
== Version 0.8.0

Released on 2016-05-10.

=== Main changes

- Add the Forth-94 core tests written by John Hayes.

=== Other changes

- Improve compilation of the assemblers: Now the contents of `base`,
  the compilation word list and the search order are saved before
  compiling the assemblers, and restored at the end.
- Add `align` and `aligned`.
- Fix `[char]`.

Released on 2016-04-09.

- Split the assembler library module into three files: z80-asm
  assembler, z80-asm-comma assembler and common tools.
- Fix the title of two 8-bit pseudo-random number generator
  benchmarks.

// Version 0.3.0  {{{1
== Version 0.3.0

Released on 2016-04-03.

- Adapt some library words to DTC.
- Fix the DTC version of `decode` and remove its ITC version.
- Add `docolon` to the kernel, needed by `decode`.
- Add `cslit` and an alternative definition of `csliteral` to the
  library.
- Improve `decode` with support for `csliteral`.
- Change the stack notation "text<c>" to "ccc<char>", after the
  standard.
- Fix `number?`: wrong numbers left a double cell on the stack under
  the TOS flag, and `base` was not restored.
- Add `number-punctuation?` to check for valid punctuation in numbers.
- Improve `number?` to recognize also comma, colon, plus, hyphen and
  slash as valid punctuation, any number of them, at any position.
  Formerly only one decimal point was allowed, at any position.
- Add `number` to the library.
- Make `.\"` independent from `s\"`.
- Replace Z80 jumps to the `push_hl` entry point of the inner
  interpreter with a `push hl` and the usual `jp (ix)` (jump to
  `next`). This saves 2 CPU cycles and needs no additional bytes.
  Benchmarks are 1% faster.
- Add `jppushhl` to the assembler wordlist in the kernel and modify
  the library code words accordingly.
- Make `number?` to reject initial or duplicated point.
- Rename all occurrences of "punctuation" to "point".
- Make `number-point?` match only the standard period. Add two
  alternatives to the library, which recognize more points.
- Add `there`, which sets `dp`.
- Convert the words `compile,`, `begin`, `<mark`, `<resolve` and
  `then` to aliases.
- Remove `next2`, which is unnecessary in DTC; update `pause` and
  `execute-hl` accordingly.
- Update some development benchmarks.
- Reorganize the source, binary and temporary files into directories.
- Add the `bank-start` constant.
- Add `save-here` and `restore-here`.

- Comment out the contrast ink calculation in `border`.
- Remove the game _Nuclear Invaders_, which temporarily had been
  included in the library.
- Split the library into files (151) and update the Makefile
  accordingly.  This makes it possible to include only the modules
  needed by the user application.
- Rename the interrupt-independent version of `inkey` to `get-inkey`.
- Rename the two versions of `key??`, which are interrup-independent,
  to `get-key?` and `fast-get-key?`.
- Fix `-suffix`.
- Add `for-i` for the `for step` loop.
- Rename `di` to `dfor-i` for the `dfor dstep` loop.

  generators.  Update the benchmarks of all of them.
- Improve the documentation of many words.
- Add `indexer`, a tool that indexes the library and makes `need`,
  `needed`, `reneed` and `reneeded` much faster.
- Add `cell/`, `d10*` and `bits` to the library.

// Version 0.2.0  {{{1
== Version 0.2.0

// Version 0.1.0  {{{1
== Version 0.1.0

Released on 2016-03-14.

Many fixes, changes and improvements. See the
http://programandala.net/en.program.solo_forth.history.html[development
history].

- The Vim syntax file for Solo Forth is included.

// Version 0.0.0  {{{1
== Version 0.0.0

Developed from 2015-06-02 to 2015-12-18.

During this long initial period of the development, Solo Forth grew
from a small seed (the code of Abersoft Forth, a fig-Forth 1.1) to a
disk-based system, with only some small traces of fig-Forth left, with
many features of modern standard Forth systems and a huge library of
optional code.

Version branch 0.0 was finished after replacing the fig-Forth `do
loop` control structures with the Forth-83 version, adding a method to
nest sources (`nest-source` and `unnest-source`) and writing
`evaluate`.
