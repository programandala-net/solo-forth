== 0.0

Developed from 2015-06-02 to 2015-12-18.

During this long initial period of the development, Solo Forth grew
from a small seed (the code of Abersoft Forth, a fig-Forth 1.1) to a
disk-based system, with only some small traces of fig-Forth left, with
many features of modern standard Forth systems and a huge library of
optional code.

Version branch 0.0 was finished after replacing the fig-Forth `do
loop` control structures with the Forth-83 version, adding a method to
nest sources (`nest-source` and `unnest-source`) and writing
`evaluate`.

== 0.1.0

Developed from 2015-12-18 to 2016-03-14.

Many fixes, changes and improvements. See the
http://programandala.net/en.program.solo_forth.history.html[development
history].

- The Vim syntax file for Solo Forth is included.

== 0.2.0

Released on 2016-03-14.

- The old alternative ITC code is removed.

== 0.3.0

Developed from 2016-03-14 to 2016-04-03.

- Adapt some library words to DTC.
- Fix the DTC version of `decode` and remove its ITC version.
- Add `docolon` to the kernel, needed by `decode`.
- Add `cslit` and an alternative definition of `csliteral` to the
  library.
- Improve `decode` with support for `csliteral`.
- Change the stack notation "text<c>" to "ccc<char>", after the
  standard.
- Fix `number?`: wrong numbers left a double cell on the stack under
  the TOS flag, and `base` was not restored.
- Add `number-punctuation?` to check for valid punctuation in numbers.
- Improve `number?` to recognize also comma, colon, plus, hyphen and
  slash as valid punctuation, any number of them, at any position.
  Formerly only one decimal point was allowed, at any position.
- Add `number` to the library.
- Make `.\"` independent from `s\"`.
- Replace Z80 jumps to the `push_hl` entry point of the inner
  interpreter with a `push hl` and the usual `jp (ix)` (jump to
  `next`). This saves 2 CPU cycles and needs no additional bytes.
  Benchmarks are 1% faster.
- Add `jppushhl` to the assembler wordlist in the kernel and modify
  the library code words accordingly.
- Make `number?` to reject initial or duplicated point.
- Rename all occurrences of "punctuation" to "point".
- Make `number-point?` match only the standard period. Add two
  alternatives to the library, which recognize more points.
- Add `there`, which sets `dp`.
- Convert the words `compile,`, `begin`, `<mark`, `<resolve` and
  `then` to aliases.
- Remove `next2`, which is unnecessary in DTC; update `pause` and
  `execute-hl` accordingly.
- Update some development benchmarks.
- Reorganize the source, binary and temporary files into directories.
- Add the `bank-start` constant.
- Add `save-here` and `restore-here`.
- Add the `code-bank` tool (not tested yet).
- Modify the file words to return a standard ior.
- Modify `mode42` and `mode64` to implement alternative versions that
  use the code bank.
- Convert `>wid` and `wid>` to aliases.
- Add `+under`.
- Update the implementation of `wordlist` and `vocabulary`.
- Replace `get-order`.
- Add `set-default-bank`, `get-default-bank` and `default-bank#`.
- Remove parens from names of the printing mode vectors.
- Comment out the contrast ink calculation in `border`.
- Remove the game _Nuclear Invaders_, which temporarily had been
  included in the library.
- Split the library into files (151) and update the Makefile
  accordingly.  This makes it possible to include only the modules
  needed by the user application.
- Rename the interrupt-independent version of `inkey` to `get-inkey`.
- Rename the two versions of `key??`, which are interrup-independent,
  to `get-key?` and `fast-get-key?`.
- Fix `-suffix`.
- Add `for-i` for the `for step` loop.
- Rename `di` to `dfor-i` for the `dfor dstep` loop.
- Rename the words of Wil Baden's `case` structure to avoid name clash
  with the standard `case`.
- Remove old fig-Forth loop indexes from the library.
- Modify the license.
- Update and complete all of the source file headers.
- Add `?repeat`.
- Modify and factor `wid>name`.
- Simplify the storage and printing of the version number, by making
  release candidates start from 1 instead of 0.
- Include only the best implementations of pseudo-random number
  generators.  Update the benchmarks of all of them.
- Improve the documentation of many words.
- Add `indexer`, a tool that indexes the library and makes `need`,
  `needed`, `reneed` and `reneeded` much faster.
- Add `cell/`, `d10*` and `bits` to the library.

== 0.3.1

Released on 2016-04-09.

- Split the assembler library module into three files: z80-asm
  assembler, z80-asm-comma assembler and common tools.
- Fix the title of two 8-bit pseudo-random number generator
  benchmarks.
- Fix the name of the `base-execute` library module.

== 0.3.2

Released on 2016-04-09.

- Fix, improve and finish the `arguments` implementation of locals.
- Improve the documentation of some library modules.

== 0.4.0

Released on 2016-04-10.

- Tape support.
- New words: `nonfull-display`, `full-display`, `save-display` and
  `restore-display`.

// == 0.4.1

// Under development since 2016-04-09.
